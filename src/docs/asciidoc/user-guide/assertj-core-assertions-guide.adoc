[[assertj-core-assertions-guide]]
=== Core assertions guide

This section describes the assertions provided by AssertJ Core and other useful features to get the best of it.

AssertJ Core http://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.assertj/assertj-core/[javadoc] explains each assertions most of them with code examples so be sure to check it if you want to know what a specific assertion does.

[[assertj-core-simple-example]]
==== A simple example

Let's start with a simple example showing a few important things.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/SimpleAssertionsExample.java[tags=user_guide]
----
<1> Statically import `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat`
<2> Pass the object under test as the sole `assertThat()` parameter
<3> Use code completion to discover and call assertions
<4> Chain as many assertions as you need

Except for `isNotNull` which is a base assertion, the other assertions are `String` specific as our object under test is a `String`.

[[assertj-core-supported-types]]
==== Supported type assertions

AssertJ provides assertions specific to the object under test type, the following sections list the supported types grouped by categories.

The provided assertions for each of these types are documented later on.

[[assertj-core-assertion-description]]
==== Assertion description

It is often valuable to describe the assertion performed, especially for boolean assertions where the default error message just complains that it got `false` instead of `true` (or vice versa).

You can set such a description with `as(String description, Object... args)` but remember to do it before calling the assertion otherwise it is simply ignored as a failing assertion breaks the chained calls.

Example of a failing assertion with a description:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/DescribingAssertionsExample.java[tags=user_guide]
----

The error message starts with the given description in `[]` :

[source, text]
----
[check Frodo's age] expected:<100> but was:\<33>
----

[[assertj-core-assertion-description-consumer]]
===== Printing or consuming description

AssertJ can print each assertion description (when it is set), to do so call `Assertions.setPrintAssertionsDescription(true);`.

If printing assertion descriptions is not what you need, you can alternatively register a `Consumer<Description>` that will be called each time a description is set.

Both options are exposed in AssertJ link:#assertj-core-configuration[`Configuration`] class.

Example: using a description consumer
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// initialize the description consumer
final StringBuilder descriptionReportBuilder = new StringBuilder(String.format("Assertions:%n"));
Consumer<Description> descriptionConsumer = desc -> descriptionReportBuilder.append(String.format("-- %s%n", desc));

// use the description consumer for any following assertions descriptions.
Assertions.setDescriptionConsumer(descriptionConsumer);

// execute some assertions
TolkienCharacter frodo = new TolkienCharacter("Frodo", 33, Race.HOBBIT);
assertThat(frodo.getName()).as("check name")
                          .isEqualTo("Frodo");
assertThat(frodo.getAge()).as("check age")
                          .isEqualTo(33);

// get the report
String descriptionReport = descriptionReportBuilder.toString();
----
resulting `descriptionReport`:
[source, text]
----
Assertions:
-- check name
-- check age
----


[[assertj-core-overriding-error-message]]
==== Overriding error message

AssertJ tries its best to give helpful error messages, but you can always change it with `overridingErrorMessage()` or `withFailMessage()`.

Example with this failing test:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/OverridingErrorMessageExample.java[tags=user_guide]
----

The error message is:

[source, text]
----
java.lang.AssertionError: should be TolkienCharacter [name=Frodo, age=33, race=HOBBIT]
----

[[assertj-core-lazy-error-message]]
===== Lazy error message overriding

If the error message is expensive to build, use the overloaded methods taking a `Supplier<String>` instead of a `String`, the message will only be built if the assertion fails.

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
assertThat(player.isRookie()).overridingErrorMessage(() -> "Expecting Player to be a rookie but was not.")
                             .isTrue();

assertThat(player.isRookie()).withFailMessage(() -> "Expecting Player to be a rookie but was not.")
                             .isTrue();
----


[[assertj-core-incorrect-usage]]
==== Avoiding incorrect usage

There are a few things to keep in mind when using AssertJ to avoid misusing it.

===== Forgetting to call an assertion

The main trap is to pass the object under to test to `assertThat()` and forget to call an assertion afterward.
This misuse can be detected by https://spotbugs.github.io/[SpotBugs] or http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/[Findbugs] thanks to the `@CheckReturnValue` annotation on all `assertThat()` methods.

Here's what it looks like in SpotBugs:
[#img-sunset]
.SpotBugs detecting AssertJ invalid usage
image::spotbugs-invalid-assertj-usage-detection.png[SpotBugs detecting AssertJ invalid usage]

The following examples show incorrect AssertJ API usage to avoid!

[.bad]#Bad#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DON'T DO THIS ! It does not assert anything
assertThat(actual.equals(expected));
----

[.good]#Good#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DO THIS:
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected);

// OR THIS (less classy but ok):
assertThat(actual.equals(expected)).isTrue();
----

[.bad]#Bad#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DON'T DO THIS ! It does not assert anything and passes
assertThat(1 == 2);

----

[.good]#Good#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DO THIS: (fails as expected)
assertThat(1).isEqualTo(2);

// OR THIS (less classy but ok):
assertThat(1 == 2).isTrue();
----

===== Calling as() after the assertion

Describing an assertion must be done before calling the assertion otherwise it is ignored as a failing assertion breaks will prevent the call to `as()`.

[.bad]#Bad#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DON'T DO THIS ! as/describedAs have no effect after the assertion
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).as("description");
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).describedAs("description");
----

[.good]#Good#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DO THIS: use as/describedAs before the assertion
assertThat(actual).as("description").isEqualTo(expected);
assertThat(actual).describedAs("description").isEqualTo(expected);
----

===== Calling withFailMessage/overridingErrorMessage after the assertion

Setting an error message must be done before calling the assertion otherwise it is ignored as a failing assertion breaks will prevent the call to `withFailMessage()` / `overridingErrorMessage()`.

[.bad]#Bad#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DON'T DO THIS ! overridingErrorMessage/withFailMessage have no effect after the assertion
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).overridingErrorMessage("custom error message");
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).withFailMessage("custom error message");
----

[.good]#Good#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DO THIS: use overridingErrorMessage/withFailMessage before the assertion
assertThat(actual).overridingErrorMessage("custom error message").isEqualTo(expected);
assertThat(actual).withFailMessage("custom error message").isEqualTo(expected);
----

===== Setting a comparator after the assertion

Setting comparators must be done before calling the assertion otherwise it is ignored as a failing assertion breaks will prevent the call to `usingComparator()` / `usingElementComparator()`.

[.bad]#Bad#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DON'T DO THIS ! Comparator is not used
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).usingComparator(new CustomComparator());
----

[.good]#Good#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DO THIS:
assertThat(actual).usingComparator(new CustomComparator()).isEqualTo("a");
----

[[assertj-core-configuration]]
==== Configuring AssertJ

This section describes the different ways to configure AssertJ, either by setting configuration properties individually or globally using the link:#assertj-configuration[`Configuration`] class.

To be effective the configuration changes must be applied before the tests are executed, depending on the scope of the tests this means different things:

* For a single test: change the configuration in the test and revert it in the https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/AfterEach.html[`@AfterEach`] method  (JUnit 5).
* For all tests in a class: change the configuration in the https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/BeforeAll.html[`@BeforeAll`] method and revert the changes in the https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/AfterAll.html[`@AfterAll`] method (JUnit 5).
* To change the configuration *before any tests*, you can use these options:
** write a JUnit 5 extension implementing https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/BeforeAllCallback.html[`BeforeAllCallback`].
** register your own `Configuration` subclass and let AssertJ link:#automatic-configuration-discovery[discover it automagically].

===== Configuring single properties

The `Assertions` class provides static methods to change each configuration properties.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
Assertions.setAllowComparingPrivateFields(true);
Assertions.setAllowExtractingPrivateFields(false);
Assertions.setExtractBareNamePropertyMethods(false);
Assertions.setLenientDateParsing(true);
Assertions.setMaxElementsForPrinting(100);
Assertions.setMaxLengthForSingleLineDescription(250);
Assertions.setRemoveAssertJRelatedElementsFromStackTrace(true);
Assertions.useRepresentation(myRepresentation);
Assertions.registerCustomDateFormat(myCustomDateFormat);
Assertions.setPrintAssertionsDescription(true);
Assertions.setConsumerDescription(description -> writeToFile(description, report));
----

====== Representation

This property allows you to register a `Representation` to control the way AssertJ formats the different types displayed in the assertion error messages.
Consult the <<assertj-core-representation>> chapter for details.

Defaults to `StandardRepresentation`.

====== AllowComparingPrivateFields

Globally sets whether the use of private fields is allowed for field/property by field/property comparison. Defaults to true.

====== AllowExtractingPrivateFields

Globally sets whether the AssertJ `extracting` capability should be allowed to extract private fields. Defaults to true.

====== ExtractBareNamePropertyMethods

Globally sets whether the AssertJ `extracting` capability considers bare-named property methods like String name(). Defaults to true.

====== LenientDateParsing

Specify whether or not date/time parsing is to be lenient for AssertJ default date formats. With lenient parsing, the parser may use heuristics to interpret inputs that do not precisely match this object's format. With strict parsing, inputs must match this object's format.

====== Custom DateFormat

In addition to the default date formats, you can register some custom ones that AssertJ will use in date assertions (see also `Assertions.registerCustomDateFormat`).

Note that custom date formats take precedence over default ones.

====== MaxElementsForPrinting

In error messages, sets the threshold for how many elements from one iterable/array/map will be included in the in the description. Defaults to 1000.

The point of this property is to avoid printing iterable/array/map with too many elements in error messages.

====== MaxLengthForSingleLineDescription

In error messages, sets the threshold when iterable/array formatting will be on one line (if their String description
is less than this parameter) or it will be formatted with one element per line. Defaults to 80.

Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
String[] greatBooks = array("A Game of Thrones", "The Lord of the Rings", "Assassin's Apprentice");
----

this array is formatted on one line as its length < 80:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
["A Game of Thrones", "The Lord of the Rings", "Assassin's Apprentice"]
----

Whereas this array ...

[source,java,indent=0]
----
String[] greatBooks = array("A Game of Thrones", "The Lord of the Rings", "Assassin's Apprentice", "Guards! Guards! (Discworld)");
----

\... is formatted on multiple lines with one element per line:

[source,java,indent=0]
----

["A Game of Thrones",
 "The Lord of the Rings",
 "Assassin's Apprentice",
 "Guards! Guards! (Discworld)"]
----

====== RemoveAssertJRelatedElementsFromStackTrace

Sets whether the elements related to AssertJ are removed from assertion errors stack trace. Defaults to true.


[[assertj-configuration]]
===== AssertJ Configuration

Since 3.13.0, AssertJ exposes a `org.assertj.core.configuration.Configuration` object providing access to all AssertJ globally configurable properties.

You can create an instance of `org.assertj.core.configuration.Configuration` and change indivual properties through setters or create your own custom configuration by inheriting from it and overriding the methods to change the default behavior as in the `CustomConfiguration` example below.

IMPORTANT: Your configuration will be effective once you call `Configuration.apply()` or `Configuration.applyAndDisplay()`.

Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
Configuration configuration = new Configuration();

configuration.setBareNamePropertyExtraction(false);
configuration.setComparingPrivateFields(false);
configuration.setExtractingPrivateFields(false);
configuration.setLenientDateParsing(true);
configuration.setMaxElementsForPrinting(1001);
configuration.setMaxLengthForSingleLineDescription(81);
configuration.setRemoveAssertJRelatedElementsFromStackTrace(false);

// don't forget to apply it!
configuration.applyAndDisplay();
----

Printing the above configuration produces the following output:

[source,plaintext,indent=0]
----
Applying configuration org.assertj.core.configuration.Configuration
- representation .................................. = BinaryRepresentation
- comparingPrivateFieldsEnabled ................... = false
- extractingPrivateFieldsEnabled .................. = true
- bareNamePropertyExtractionEnabled ............... = false
- lenientDateParsingEnabled ....................... = true
- additionnal date formats ........................ = [yyyy_MM_dd, yyyy|MM|dd]
- maxLengthForSingleLineDescription ............... = 150
- maxElementsForPrinting .......................... = 2000
- removeAssertJRelatedElementsFromStackTraceEnabled = true
----


[[automatic-configuration-discovery]]
===== Automagic configuration discovery

This section describes a way to register an AssertJ `Configuration` without using any test framework hooks like `BeforeAllCallback`.

Follow the steps below to register your `Configuration` as an SPI:

* Create your own configuration inheriting from `org.assertj.core.configuration.Configuration`
* Create a file named `org.assertj.core.configuration.Configuration` in a `META-INF/services` directory
* Make sure `META-INF/services/` is in the runtime classpath, usually putting it in `src/test/resources` will do.
* Put the fully qualified class name of your `Configuration` in `services/org.assertj.core.configuration.Configuration`.

This is all you have to do, AssertJ will pick up the `Configuration` automatically and display it at the first interaction with AssertJ.

Here's an example of a custom configuration class:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/CustomConfiguration.java[]
----

With this custom configuration, the content of `META-INF/services/org.assertj.core.configuration.Configuration` must be:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
example.core.CustomConfiguration
----

Printing the  `CustomConfiguration` shows:
[source,plaintext,indent=0]
----
Applying configuration example.core.CustomConfiguration
- representation .................................. = BinaryRepresentation
- comparingPrivateFieldsEnabled ................... = false
- extractingPrivateFieldsEnabled .................. = true
- bareNamePropertyExtractionEnabled ............... = false
- lenientDateParsingEnabled ....................... = true
- additionnal date formats ........................ = [yyyy_MM_dd, yyyy|MM|dd]
- maxLengthForSingleLineDescription ............... = 150
- maxElementsForPrinting .......................... = 2000
- removeAssertJRelatedElementsFromStackTraceEnabled = true
----



[[assertj-core-representation]]
==== Controlling type formatting

Assertions error messages use a `Representation` to format the different types involved. There are multiple ways of registering a custom `Representation` for assertions:

* Changing the default global `Representation` by calling `Assertions.useRepresentation(myRepresentation)` - see <<Changing the default global scope custom representation>>
* Changing the `Representation` per assertion with `assertThat(actual).withRepresentation(myRepresentation)` - see <<Per assertion scope custom representation>>
* Globally registering a `Configuration` that specifies the `Representation` to use - see link:#assertj-core-configuration[AssertJ global configuration].
* Registering multiple link:#assertj-core-fine-grained-representations[fine grained representations] that only defines representation of their custom types.

Let's go over these different options with a custom `Representation`.

[[assertj-core-custom-representation]]
===== Creating a custom Representation

An example of a custom `Representation`:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// dummy class
private class Example {}

public class CustomRepresentation extends StandardRepresentation { // <1>

  // override fallbackToStringOf to handle Example formatting
  @Override
  public String fallbackToStringOf(Object o) { // <2>
    if (o instanceof Example) return "Example";
    // fallback to default formatting.
    return super.fallbackToStringOf(o);
  }

  // override a predefined type formatting : String
  @Override
  protected String toStringOf(String str) { // <3>
    return "$" + str + "$";
  }
}
----
<1> Extends `org.assertj.core.presentation.StandardRepresentation` to get AssertJ default representation.
<2> Override `fallbackToStringOf` and handle your specific types before falling back to the default formatting.
<3> Change a predefined type formatting by overriding the `toStringOf` method that takes it as a parameter.

Let's see the above custom representation in action when representing `Example` or `String` instances.

This assertion fails ...
[source,java,indent=0]
----
assertThat(new Example()).isNull();
----
...with the following error:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
expected:<[null]> but was:<[Example]>
----

This one fails ...
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// this one fails ...
assertThat("foo").startsWith("bar");
----
...with the following error:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
Expecting:
  <$foo$>
to start with:
  <$bar$>
----

[[assertj-core-custom-representation-global-scope-change]]
===== Changing the default global scope custom representation

You only have to register `CustomRepresentation` once but need to do it before executing any tests, for the tests executed before that, AssertJ will use the default representation.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
// to call before executing tests
Assertions.useRepresentation(new CustomRepresentation());
----

Consider writing a JUnit 5 extension implementing https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/BeforeAllCallback.html[`BeforeAllCallback`] to make sure the representation is set once for all before any test is executed.

[[assertj-core-custom-representation-per-assertion-scope]]
===== Per assertion scope custom representation

Follow this approach if you want to use a specific representation for a single assertion only.

Example with the failing assertions used before:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
Representation customRepresentation = new CustomRepresentation();

// this assertion fails ...
assertThat(new Example()).withRepresentation(customRepresentation)
                         .isNull();

assertThat("foo").withRepresentation(customRepresentation)
                 .startsWith("bar");
----


[[assertj-core-fine-grained-representations]]
===== Registering multiple fine-grained representations

Since 3.22.0 AssertJ allows registering multiple representations (one per jar).

The typical use case is for different domain-specific libraries to be able to independently register `Representation` implementations for their specific domain objects.

[NOTE]
====
In case different representations can represent the same type, the one with the highest priority wins.
====

Let's take a concrete example where we have two domain specific libraries: Lotr and star wars and a project that uses them both.

The Lotr library is composed of an `Hobbit` class and a specific representation for it, note that `LotrRepresentation` represents Hobbits starting with `HOBBIT` unlike `Hobbit` `toString` method:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
package org.assertj.example.lotr;

public class Hobbit {

  public String name;
  public String age;

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return format("Hobbit [name=%s, age=%s]", name, age);
  }
}

public class LotrRepresentation implements Representation {

  @Override
  public String toStringOf(Object object) {
    if (object instanceof Hobbit) {
      Hobbit hobbit = (Hobbit) object;
      return String.format("HOBBIT [name=%s, age=%s]", hobbit.name, hobbit.age);
    }
    return null;
  }

  // only needed if another library was to represent Hobbit, in this case the one with highest priority wins
  @Override
  public int getPriority() {
    return 5;
  }
}
----

`LotrRepresentation` is registered by creating a `META-INF/services/org.assertj.core.presentation.Representation` file that contain `org.assertj.example.lotr.LotrRepresentation`, the file must be available in the classpath (typically by putting in it src/main/resources it will end up in the library jar).

Similarly the star wars library defines a `Jedi` and a `StarWarsRepresentation`:

[source,java]
----
package org.assertj.example.starwars;

public class Jedi {

  public String name;
  public String age;

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return format("Jedi [name=%s, age=%s]", name, age);
  }
}

public class StarWarsRepresentation implements Representation {

  @Override
  public String toStringOf(Object object) {
    if (object instanceof Jedi) {
      Jedi jedi = (Jedi) object;
      return String.format("JEDI [name=%s, age=%s]", jedi.name, jedi.age);
    }
    return null;
  }

  @Override
  public int getPriority() {
    return 10;
  }
}
----

Same as the Lotr library, `StarWarsRepresentation` is registered by creating a `META-INF/services/org.assertj.core.presentation.Representation` file that contain `org.assertj.example.starwars.StarWarsRepresentation`.

The consuming project specifies both libraries as dependencies, since both have registered a representation, AssertJ will discover them and keep them in a composite representation that aggregates all registered representaions.

The following test fails with frodo and luke being represented by `LotrRepresentation` and `StarWarsRepresentation` respectively.
[source,java]
----
Hobbit frodo = new Hobbit();
frodo.name = "Frodo";
frodo.age = "33";

Jedi luke = new Jedi();
luke.name = "Luke";
luke.age = "23";

assertThat(frodo).isEqualTo(luke);
----

Error message:
[source,text]
----
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError:
expected: JEDI [name=Luke, age=23]
 but was: HOBBIT [name=Frodo, age=33]
----

[[assertj-core-group-assertions-reference]]
===== Reference

All the available assertions are described in:

* arrays: {assertj-core-javadoc-root}org/assertj/core/api/AbstractObjectArrayAssert.html#method.summary

* link:#assertj-core-group-extracting[Extracting/mapping] elements before asserting
* link:#assertj-core-group-comparator[Comparing elements] with a specific comparator

[[assertj-core-group-contains]]
===== Checking iterables/arrays content

There are different flavors of `contains` assertion, here's a table to help choose the most relevant one:

[%autowidth]
|===
|Assertion |Description

|{assertj-core-javadoc-root}org/assertj/core/api/AbstractIterableAssert.html#contains(ELEMENT&#46;&#46;&#46;)[`contains`]
|Verifies that the actual iterable/array contains the given values in any order

|{assertj-core-javadoc-root}org/assertj/core/api/AbstractIterableAssert.html#containsOnly(ELEMENT&#46;&#46;&#46;)[`containsOnly`]
|Verifies that the actual group contains only the given values and nothing else in any order and ignoring duplicates (i.e. once a value is found, its duplicates are also considered found)

|{assertj-core-javadoc-root}org/assertj/core/api/AbstractIterableAssert.html#containsExactly(ELEMENT&#46;&#46;&#46;)[`containsExactly`]
|Verifies that the actual iterable/array contains exactly the given values and nothing else **in order**

|{assertj-core-javadoc-root}org/assertj/core/api/AbstractIterableAssert.html#containsExactlyInAnyOrder(ELEMENT&#46;&#46;&#46;)[`containsExactlyInAnyOrder`]
|Verifies that the actual iterable/array contains exactly the given values and nothing else **in any order**

|{assertj-core-javadoc-root}org/assertj/core/api/AbstractIterableAssert.html#containsSequence(ELEMENT&#46;&#46;&#46;)[`containsSequence`]
|Verifies that the actual group contains the given sequence in the correct order and **without extra values between the sequence values**

|{assertj-core-javadoc-root}org/assertj/core/api/AbstractIterableAssert.html#containsSubsequence(ELEMENT&#46;&#46;&#46;)[`containsSubsequence`]
|Verifies that the actual group contains the given subsequence in the correct order **possibly with other values between them**

|{assertj-core-javadoc-root}org/assertj/core/api/AbstractIterableAssert.html#containsOnlyOnce(ELEMENT&#46;&#46;&#46;)[`containsOnlyOnce`]
|Verifies that the actual iterable/array contains the given values only once

|{assertj-core-javadoc-root}org/assertj/core/api/AbstractIterableAssert.html#containsAnyOf(ELEMENT&#46;&#46;&#46;)[`containsAnyOf`]
|Verifies that the actual iterable/array contains at least one of the given values (like an `or` operator on the given values)

|===

TIP: the assertions above have a variant accepting an iterable/array argument, ex: `containsExactly(E...)` and `containsExactlyElementsOf(Iterable)`

[[assertj-core-group-satisfy]]
===== Verify assertions on some elements

====== Satisfy

You can assert that all or any elements verify the given assertions with `allSatisfy` and `anySatisfy`, conversely `noneSatisfy` lets you assert that no elements verify the given assertions.

The given assertions are expressed with a `Consumer` (typically with a lambda).

Examples:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
List<TolkienCharacter> hobbits = list(frodo, sam, pippin);

// all elements must satisfy the given assertions
assertThat(hobbits).allSatisfy(character -> {
  assertThat(character.getRace()).isEqualTo(HOBBIT);
  assertThat(character.getName()).isNotEqualTo("Sauron");
});

// at least one element must satisfy the given assertions
assertThat(hobbits).anySatisfy(character -> {
  assertThat(character.getRace()).isEqualTo(HOBBIT);
  assertThat(character.getName()).isEqualTo("Sam");
});

// no element must satisfy the given assertions
assertThat(hobbits).noneSatisfy(character -> assertThat(character.getRace()).isEqualTo(ELF));
----

NOTE: if `allSatisfy` fails, all the elements and their failing the assertions are reported.

====== Match

You can assert that all or any elements match the given `Predicate` with `allMatch` and `anyMatch`, conversely `noneMatch` lets you assert that no elements verify the given predicate.

Examples:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
List<TolkienCharacter> hobbits = list(frodo, sam, pippin);

assertThat(hobbits).allMatch(character -> character.getRace() == HOBBIT, "hobbits")
                   .anyMatch(character -> character.getName().contains("pp"))
                   .noneMatch(character -> character.getRace() == ORC);
----

TIP: You can pass a predicate description to make the error message more explicit if the assertion fails.

[[assertj-core-group-navigation]]
===== Navigating to a given element

The idea is to navigate to a given element in order to check it, you can navigate to the link:#assertj-core-group-navigation-fle[first, last or any element by index] or if you expect only one element use link:#assertj-core-group-navigation-singleElement[`singleElement`].

NOTE: this is only available for iterables at the moment.

[[assertj-core-group-navigation-fle]]
====== First / last / element(index)

Use `first`, `last` and `element(index)` to navigate to the corresponding element, after navigating you can only use object assertions unless you have specified an Assert class or preferrably an `InstanceOfAssertFactory` as shown in the following examples.

Examples:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// only object assertions available after navigation
Iterable<TolkienCharacter> hobbits = list(frodo, sam, pippin);
assertThat(hobbits).first().isEqualTo(frodo);
assertThat(hobbits).element(1).isEqualTo(sam);
assertThat(hobbits).last().isEqualTo(pippin);

// strongly typed String assertions after navigation
Iterable<String> hobbitsName = list("frodo", "sam", "pippin");
// STRING is an InstanceOfAssertFactory from org.assertj.core.api.InstanceOfAssertFactories.STRING
// as() is just synthetic sugar for readability
assertThat(hobbitsName).first(as(STRING))
                       .startsWith("fro")
                       .endsWith("do");
assertThat(hobbitsName).element(1, as(STRING))
                       .startsWith("sa")
                       .endsWith("am");
assertThat(hobbitsName).last(as(STRING))
                       .startsWith("pip")
                       .endsWith("pin");

// alternative for strongly typed assertions
assertThat(hobbitsName, StringAssert.class).first()
                                           .startsWith("fro")
                                           .endsWith("do");
----

[[assertj-core-group-navigation-singleElement]]
====== Single element

`singleElement` checks that the iterable has only one element and navigates to it, after navigating you can only use object assertions unless you have specified an Assert class or preferrably an `InstanceOfAssertFactory` as shown in the following examples.

Examples:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
Iterable<String> babySimpsons = list("Maggie");

// only object assertions available
assertThat(babySimpsons).singleElement()
                        .isEqualTo("Maggie");

// to get specific typed assertions, pass the corresponding InstanceOfAssertFactory from
// org.assertj.core.api.InstanceOfAssertFactories.STRING), as() is just synthetic sugar for readability
assertThat(babySimpsons).singleElement(as(STRING))
                        .endsWith("gie");

// alternative for strongly typed assertions
assertThat(babySimpsons, StringAssert.class).singleElement()
                                            .startsWith("Mag");
----

[[assertj-core-group-filtering]]
===== Filtering elements

Filtering is handy to target assertions on some specific elements, the filter criteria can be expressed by:

* a link:#filtering-with-a-predicate[java Predicate]
* an link:#filtering-on-a-property-or-a-field[element property/field having a specific value (or not) or in a set of values (or not)]
* an link:#filtering-on-null-value[element property/field having a null value]
* an element link:#filtering-elements-matchin-given-assertions[matching some assertions]
* an element matching a link:#filtering-with-a-condition[Condition]

Let's explore these options in some examples taken from {assertj-examples-repo}/tree/main/assertions-examples/src/test/java/org/assertj/examples/FilterExamples.java#L47[FilterExamples] from the {assertj-examples-repo}[assertions-examples] project.

====== Filtering with a Predicate

You specify the filter condition using simple predicate, best expressed with a lambda.

Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).filteredOn( character -> character.getName().contains("o") )
                               .containsOnly(aragorn, frodo, legolas, boromir);
----

====== Filtering on a property or a field

First you specify the property/field name to filter on and then its expected value. The filter first tries to get the value from a property, then from a field. Reading private fields is supported by default, but can be disabled globally by calling `Assertions.setAllowExtractingPrivateFields(false)`.

Filter supports nested properties/fields. Note that if an intermediate value is null the whole nested property/field is considered to be null, for example reading `"address.street.name"` will return null if `"address.street"` is null.

Filters support these basic operations : `not`, `in`, `notIn`

[source,java,indent=0]
----
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.in;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.not;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.notIn;
...

// filters use introspection to get property/field values
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).filteredOn("race", HOBBIT)
                               .containsOnly(sam, frodo, pippin, merry);

// nested properties are supported
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).filteredOn("race.name", "Man")
                               .containsOnly(aragorn, boromir);

// you can apply different comparison
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).filteredOn("race", notIn(HOBBIT, MAN))
                               .containsOnly(gandalf, gimli, legolas);

assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).filteredOn("race", in(MAIA, MAN))
                               .containsOnly(gandalf, boromir, aragorn);

assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).filteredOn("race", not(HOBBIT))
                               .containsOnly(gandalf, boromir, aragorn, gimli, legolas);

// you can chain multiple filter criteria
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).filteredOn("race", MAN)
                               .filteredOn("name", not("Boromir"))
                               .containsOnly(aragorn);
----

====== Filtering on a function return value

This is a more flexible way of getting the value to filter on but note that there is no support for operators like `not`, `in` and `notIn`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).filteredOn(TolkienCharacter::getRace, HOBBIT)
                               .containsOnly(sam, frodo, pippin, merry);
----

====== Filtering on null value

Filters the elements whose specified property/field is null.

Filter supports nested properties/fields. Note that if an intermediate value is null the whole nested property/field is considered to be null, for example reading `"address.street.name"` will return null if `"address.street"` is null.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
TolkienCharacter pippin = new TolkienCharacter("Pippin", 28, HOBBIT);
TolkienCharacter frodo = new TolkienCharacter("Frodo", 33, HOBBIT);
TolkienCharacter merry = new TolkienCharacter("Merry", 36, HOBBIT);
TolkienCharacter mysteriousHobbit = new TolkienCharacter(null, 38, HOBBIT);

List<TolkienCharacter> hobbits = list(frodo, mysteriousHobbit, merry, pippin);

assertThat(hobbits).filteredOnNull("name"))
                   .singleElement()
                   .isEqualTo(mysteriousHobbit);
----

====== Filtering elements matchin given assertions

Filters the iterable under test keeping only elements matching the given assertions specified with a `Consumer`.

Example: check hobbits whose age < 34
[source,java,indent=0]
----
TolkienCharacter pippin = new TolkienCharacter("Pippin", 28, HOBBIT);
TolkienCharacter frodo = new TolkienCharacter("Frodo", 33, HOBBIT);
TolkienCharacter merry = new TolkienCharacter("Merry", 36, HOBBIT);
TolkienCharacter sam = new TolkienCharacter("Sam", 38, HOBBIT);

List<TolkienCharacter> hobbits = list(frodo, sam, merry, pippin);

assertThat(hobbits).filteredOnAssertions(hobbit -> assertThat(hobbit.age).isLessThan(34))
                   .containsOnly(frodo, pippin);
----
====== Filtering with a Condition

Filter the iterable/array under test keeping only elements matching the given link:#assertj-core-conditions[`Condition`].

Two methods are available : being(Condition) and having(Condition). They do the same job - pick the one that makes your code more readable!

[source,java,indent=0]
----
import org.assertj.core.api.Condition;

Condition<Player> mvpStats= new Condition<Player>(player -> {
    return player.pointsPerGame() > 20 && (player.assistsPerGame() >= 8 || player.reboundsPerGame() >= 8);
  }, "mvp");

List<Player> players;
players.add(rose); // Derrick Rose : 25 ppg - 8 assists - 5 rebounds
players.add(lebron); // Lebron James : 27 ppg - 6 assists - 9 rebounds
players.add(noah); // Joachim Noah : 8 ppg - 5 assists - 11 rebounds

// noah does not have more than 20 ppg
assertThat(players).filteredOn(mvpStats)
                   .containsOnly(rose, lebron);
----

[[assertj-core-group-extracting]]
===== Extracting elements values

====== What problem extracting solves

Let's say you have called some service and got a list (or an array) of `TolkienCharacter`, to check the results you have to build the expected TolkienCharacters, that can be quite tedious!

[source,java,indent=0]
----
List<TolkienCharacter> fellowshipOfTheRing = tolkienDao.findHeroes();  // frodo, sam, aragorn ...

// requires creation of frodo and aragorn, the expected TolkienCharacters
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).contains(frodo, aragorn);
----

Instead, it is usually enough to check some fields or properties on the elements, for that you have to extract the fields/properties before performing your assertions, something like:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
// extract the names ...
List<String> names = fellowshipOfTheRing.stream().map(TolkienCharacter::getName).collect(toList());
// ... and finally assert something
assertThat(names).contains("Boromir", "Gandalf", "Frodo", "Legolas");
----

This is too much work (even with the stream API), instead AssertJ can help extracting values from the elements under tests, there are several ways of doing so:

* Extracting a link:#extracting-single-value-per-element[single value] per element
* Extracting a link:#extracting-multiple-values[multiple values] per element
* Extracting and link:#group-flat-extracting[flattening multiple values] per element

====== Extracting single value per element

Specify the field/property to extract (or pass a `Function`) from each elements and perform assertions on the extracted values.

Extracting by name can access private fields/properties which is handy to check internals not exposed with public methods (lambda won't work here), it also supports nested field/property like `"race.name"`.

Examples:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// "name" needs to be either a property or a field of the TolkienCharacter class
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).extracting("name")
                               .contains("Boromir", "Gandalf", "Frodo", "Legolas")
                               .doesNotContain("Sauron", "Elrond");

// specifying nested field/property is supported
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).extracting("race.name")
                               .contains("Man", "Maia", "Hobbit", "Elf");

// same thing with a lambda which is type safe and refactoring friendly:
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).extracting(TolkienCharacter::getName)
                               .contains("Boromir", "Gandalf", "Frodo", "Legolas");

// same thing map an alias of extracting:
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).map(TolkienCharacter::getName)
                               .contains("Boromir", "Gandalf", "Frodo", "Legolas");
----

Note that extracting one property can be made strongly typed by giving the property type as the second argument.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
// to have type safe extracting, use the second parameter to pass the expected property type:
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).extracting("name", String.class)
                               .contains("Boromir", "Gandalf", "Frodo", "Legolas")
                               .doesNotContain("Sauron", "Elrond");
----

====== Extracting multiple values

You can extract several values from the elements under test and check them using {assertj-core-javadoc-root}org/assertj/core/api/Assertions.html#tuple(java.lang.Object&#46;&#46;&#46;)[tuples].

As an example, let's check the name, age and race's name of each TolkienCharacter element:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
// when checking several properties/fields you have to use tuples:
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.tuple;

// extracting name, age and and race.name nested property
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).extracting("name", "age", "race.name")
                               .contains(tuple("Boromir", 37, "Man"),
                                         tuple("Sam", 38, "Hobbit"),
                                         tuple("Legolas", 1000, "Elf"));

// same assertion with functions for type safety:
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).extracting(TolkienCharacter::getName,
                                            tolkienCharacter -> tolkienCharacter.age,
                                            tolkienCharacter -> tolkienCharacter.getRace().getName())
                                .contains(tuple("Boromir", 37, "Man"),
                                          tuple("Sam", 38, "Hobbit"),
                                          tuple("Legolas", 1000, "Elf"));
----

The extracted name, age and race's name values of the current element are grouped in a tuple, thus you need to use tuples for specifying the expected values.

More examples are available in link:{assertj-examples-base-package}IterableAssertionsExamples.java#L210[IterableAssertionsExamples.java] of the link:{assertj-examples-repo}[assertj-examples] project.

[[group-flat-extracting]]
====== Extracting and flattening multiple values per element

Flat extracting is hard to explain but easy to understand with an example, so let's see how it works (in functional programming it is juts a flatMap).

Let's assume we have a `Player` class with a `teamMates` property returning a `List<Player>` and we want to assert that it returns the expected players:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
Player jordan = ... // initialized with Pippen and Kukoc team mates
Player magic = ... // initialized with Jabbar and Worthy team mates
List<Player> reallyGoodPlayers = list(jordan, magic);

// check all team mates by specifying the teamMates property (Player has a getTeamMates() method):
assertThat(reallyGoodPlayers).flatExtracting("teamMates")
                             .contains(pippen, kukoc, jabbar, worthy);

// alternatively, you can use a Function for type safety:
assertThat(reallyGoodPlayers).flatExtracting(BasketBallPlayer::getTeamMates)
                             .contains(pippen, kukoc, jabbar, worthy);

// flatMap is an alias of flatExtracting:
assertThat(reallyGoodPlayers).flatMap(BasketBallPlayer::getTeamMates)
                             .contains(pippen, kukoc, jabbar, worthy);

// if you use extracting instead of flatExtracting the result would be a list of list of players so the assertion becomes:
assertThat(reallyGoodPlayers).extracting("teamMates")
                             .contains(list(pippen, kukoc), list(jabbar, worthy));
----

TIP: You can use `flatMap` in place of `flatExtracting` (except for the variant taking a String)

Flat extracting can be used to group multiple values if you don't want to use `extracting` and tuples:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
// extract a list of values, flatten them and use contains assertion
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).flatExtracting("name", "race.name")
                               .contains("Frodo", "Hobbit", "Legolas", "Elf");

// same assertions with Functions:
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).flatExtracting(TolkienCharacter::getName,
                                               tc -> tc.getRace().getName())
                               .contains("Frodo", "Hobbit", "Legolas", "Elf");
----

[[assertj-core-group-comparator]]
===== Comparing elements with a specific comparator

`usingElementComparator` allows you to change the way elements are compared (instead of using the elements `equals` method).

Examples:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
List<TolkienCharacter> fellowshipOfTheRing = list(frodo, sam, merry, pippin, gandald, legolas, boromir, aragorn, gimli);

// the fellowshipOfTheRing includes Gandalf but not Sauron ...
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).contains(gandalf)
                               .doesNotContain(sauron);

// ... but if we compare only races, Sauron is in fellowshipOfTheRing since he's a Maia like Gandalf
assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).usingElementComparator((t1, t2) -> t1.getRace().compareTo(t2.getRace()))
                               .contains(sauron);
----

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions]]
==== Exception assertions

This chapter answers the question: how to assert that an exception has been thrown and check that it is the expected one?

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions-reference]]
===== Reference

All the available assertions are described in the link:{assertj-core-javadoc-root}org/assertj/core/api/AbstractThrowableAssert.html#method.summary[AbstractThrowableAssert javadoc].

In this chapter the term `exception` is used interchangeably with `throwable`.

The next sections focus on some features worth knowing to get the best of AssertJ, notably:

- link:#assertj-core-throwable-assertions-message[Checking the exception message]
- link:#assertj-core-throwable-cause-and-root-cause-assertions[Checking the exception cause and root cause]
- link:#assertj-core-exception-assertions-bdd-style[BDD assertion style with `catchThrowable` and `catchThrowableOfType`]
- link:#assertj-core-exception-assertions-assertThatThrownBy[`assertThatThrownBy(code)`]
- link:#assertj-core-exception-assertions-assertThatExceptionOfType[`assertThatExceptionOfType(exception class)`]
- link:#assertj-core-exception-assertions-no-exception[Testing that no exception is thrown]


If you use java 7, check the link:#assertj-core-exception-assertions-java-7[Java 7 section].

[[assertj-core-throwable-assertions-message]]
===== Checking exception message

There are various ways for checking the exception message content, you can check the exact message, what it contains, its start, its end, if it matches a regex.

Most of the assertions expecting a `String` can use the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html?is-external=true#format-java.lang.String-java.lang.Object...-[String.format] syntax.

Examples:
[source,java]
----
Throwable throwable = new IllegalArgumentException("wrong amount 123");

assertThat(throwableWithMessage).hasMessage("wrong amount 123")
                                .hasMessage("%s amount %d", "wrong", 123)
                                // check start
                                .hasMessageStartingWith("wrong")
                                .hasMessageStartingWith("%s a", "wrong")
                                // check content
                                .hasMessageContaining("wrong amount")
                                .hasMessageContaining("wrong %s", "amount")
                                .hasMessageContainingAll("wrong", "amount")
                                // check end
                                .hasMessageEndingWith("123")
                                .hasMessageEndingWith("amount %s", "123")
                                // check with regex
                                .hasMessageMatching("wrong amount .*")
                                // check does not contain
                                .hasMessageNotContaining("right")
                                .hasMessageNotContainingAny("right", "price")
----

[[assertj-core-throwable-cause-and-root-cause-assertions]]
===== Checking the cause and root cause

There are two approaches to check the the cause and root cause, either directly or navigate to it with `getCause()` and `getRootCause()` and check it.

====== Checking the cause

You can check the cause directly if you know it but that's not always possible, in that case you can basically only check its type.
This is pretty limited in term of assertions, a better approach is to navigate to the cause with `getCause()` and take advantage of all existing exception assertions.

Direct cause assertion are limited ...
[source,java]
----
NullPointerException cause = new NullPointerException("boom!");
Throwable throwable = new Throwable(cause);

assertThat(throwable).hasCause(cause)
                     // hasCauseInstanceOf will match inheritance.
                     .hasCauseInstanceOf(NullPointerException.class)
                     .hasCauseInstanceOf(RuntimeException.class)
                     // hasCauseExactlyInstanceOf will match only exact same type
                     .hasCauseExactlyInstanceOf(NullPointerException.class);
----

\... but navigating to the cause allows to take advantage of all exception assertions:
[source,java]
----
// navigate before checking
assertThat(throwable).getCause()
                     .hasMessage("boom!")
                     .hasMessage("%s!", "boom")
                     .hasMessageStartingWith("bo")
                     .hasMessageEndingWith("!")
                     .hasMessageContaining("boo")
                     .hasMessageContainingAll("bo", "oom", "!")
                     .hasMessageMatching("b...!")
                     .hasMessageNotContaining("bam")
                     .hasMessageNotContainingAny("bam", "bim")
                     // isInstanceOf will match inheritance.
                     .isInstanceOf(NullPointerException.class)
                     .isInstanceOf(RuntimeException.class)
                     // isExactlyInstanceOf will match only exact same type
                     .isExactlyInstanceOf(NullPointerException.class);
----

An alternative is using `assertThatExceptionOfType` combined with `havingCause` as shown in the following example:
[source,java]
----
assertThatExceptionOfType(RuntimeException.class)
         .isThrownBy(() -> { throw new RuntimeException(new IllegalArgumentException("boom!")); })
         .havingCause()
         .withMessage("boom!");
----


====== Checking the root cause

You can check the root cause directly with `hasRootCause`, `hasRootCauseMessage` and `hasRootCauseInstanceOf` if you have access to it but that's not always possible, this is a bit limited
in term of assertions, a better way is to navigate to the root cause with `getRootCause()` and take advantage of all existing exception assertions.

Examples:
[source,java]
----
NullPointerException rootCause = new NullPointerException("null!");
Throwable throwable = new Throwable(new IllegalStateException(rootCause));

// direct root cause check
assertThat(throwable).hasRootCause(rootCause)
                     .hasRootCauseMessage("null!")
                     .hasRootCauseMessage("%s!", "null")
                     // hasRootCauseInstanceOf will match inheritance
                     .hasRootCauseInstanceOf(NullPointerException.class)
                     .hasRootCauseInstanceOf(RuntimeException.class)
                     // hasRootCauseExactlyInstanceOf will match only exact same type
                     .hasRootCauseExactlyInstanceOf(NullPointerException.class);

// navigate to root cause and check
assertThat(throwable).getRootCause()
                     .hasMessage("null!")
                     .hasMessage("%s!", "null")
                     .hasMessageStartingWith("nu")
                     .hasMessageEndingWith("!")
                     .hasMessageContaining("ul")
                     .hasMessageContainingAll("nu", "ull", "l!")
                     .hasMessageMatching("n...!")
                     .hasMessageNotContaining("NULL")
                     .hasMessageNotContainingAny("Null", "NULL")
                     // isInstanceOf will match inheritance.
                     .isInstanceOf(NullPointerException.class)
                     .isInstanceOf(RuntimeException.class)
                     // isExactlyInstanceOf will match only exact same type
                     .isExactlyInstanceOf(NullPointerException.class);
----


An alternative is using `assertThatExceptionOfType` combined with `havingRootCause` as shown in the following example:
[source,java]
----
assertThatExceptionOfType(RuntimeException.class)
         .isThrownBy(() -> { throw new RuntimeException(new IllegalArgumentException(new NullPointerException("root error"))); })
         .havingRootCause()
         .withMessage("root error");
----

====== No cause

You can verify that a Throwable does not have a cause with `hasNoCause()`.

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions-bdd-style]]
===== BDD style

BDD aficionados can separate _WHEN_ and _THEN_ steps by using `catchThrowable(ThrowingCallable)` to capture the `Throwable` and then perform assertions (`ThrowingCallable` is a functional interface which can be expressed as a lambda).

Example:
[source,java]
----
// GIVEN
String[] names = { "Pier ", "Pol", "Jak" };
// WHEN
Throwable thrown = catchThrowable(() -> System.out.println(names[9]));
// THEN
then(thrown).isInstanceOf(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.class)
            .hasMessageContaining("9");

// assertThat is also available but is less "BDD style"
assertThat(thrown).isInstanceOf(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.class)
                  .hasMessageContaining("9");
----

TIP: `catchThrowable` returns null if no exception is thrown, but there is a better way to link:#assertj-core-exception-assertions-no-exception[check that no exception is thrown].

`catchThrowableOfType` is a variation of `catchThrowable` where the caught exception type is verified and returned allowing to check the custom exception fields/properties.

Example:
[source,java]
----
class TextException extends Exception {
   int line;
   int column;

   public TextException(String msg, int line, int column) {
     super(msg);
     this.line = line;
     this.column = column;
   }
 }

 TextException textException = catchThrowableOfType(() -> { throw new TextException("boom!", 1, 5); },
                                                    TextException.class);
 // assertions succeed
 assertThat(textException).hasMessageContaining("boom");
 assertThat(textException.line).isEqualTo(1);
 assertThat(textException.column).isEqualTo(5);

 // fails as TextException is not a RuntimeException
 catchThrowableOfType(() -> { throw new TextException("boom!", 1, 5); }, RuntimeException.class);
----

Although the example above can be used for any exception type, enriched alternatives for `catchThrowableOfType` are also available to catch an instance of various commonly used exceptions:

* `catchException`
* `catchIllegalArgumentException`
* `catchIllegalStateException`
* `catchIndexOutOfBoundsException`
* `catchIOException`
* `catchNullPointerException`
* `catchReflectiveOperationException`
* `catchRuntimeException`

For example, using `catchIOException`, the `ThrowingCallable` given as a parameter is executed: `catchIOException` returns null if no exception is thrown, otherwise it checks that the caught `Throwable` is of type `IOException` and casts it, making it convenient to perform subtype-specific assertions on it.

[source,java]
----
IOException iOException = catchIOException(() -> {throw new IOException("boom!");});
// assertions succeed
assertThat(iOException).hasMessage("boom!");

// succeeds as catchIOException returns null when the code does not throw any exceptions
assertThat(catchIOException(() -> {})).isNull();

// fails as the thrown instance is not an IOException
catchIOException(() -> {throw new Exception("boom!");});
----

The other `catchXXX` alternatives work the same way for their respective exception type.

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions-assertThatThrownBy]]
===== assertThatThrownBy

`assertThatThrownBy(ThrowingCallable)` is an alternative to `catchThrowable`, use it if you find more readable.

Example:
[source,java]
----
assertThatThrownBy(() -> { throw new Exception("boom!"); }).isInstanceOf(Exception.class)
                                                           .hasMessageContaining("boom");
----

NOTE: If the provided `ThrowingCallable` does not raise an exception, an assertion error is immediately thrown.

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions-assertThatExceptionOfType]]
===== assertThatExceptionOfType

`assertThatExceptionOfType` is an alternative syntax that some people find more natural.
[source,java]
----
assertThatExceptionOfType(IOException.class).isThrownBy(() -> { throw new IOException("boom!"); })
                                            .withMessage("%s!", "boom")
                                            .withMessageContaining("boom")
                                            .withNoCause();
----

NOTE: If the provided `ThrowingCallable` does not raise an exception, an assertion error is immediately thrown.

Similarly to `catchThrowableOfType`, the latter syntax has been enriched for commonly used exceptions:

* `assertThatNullPointerException`
* `assertThatIllegalArgumentException`
* `assertThatIllegalStateException`
* `assertThatIOException`

The previous example can be rewritten as:
[source,java]
----
assertThatIOException().isThrownBy(() -> { throw new IOException("boom!"); })
                       .withMessage("%s!", "boom")
                       .withMessageContaining("boom")
                       .withNoCause();
----

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions-no-exception]]
===== Testing that no exception is thrown

You can test that a piece of code does not throw any exception with:
[source,java]
----
// standard style
assertThatNoException().isThrownBy(() -> System.out.println("OK"));
// BDD style
thenNoException().isThrownBy(() -> System.out.println("OK"));
----
or similarly:
[source,java]
----
// standard style
assertThatCode(() -> System.out.println("OK")).doesNotThrowAnyException();
// BDD style
thenCode(() -> System.out.println("OK")).doesNotThrowAnyException();
----

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions-java-7]]
===== With Java 7 (AssertJ 2.x)

Asserting on exceptions is not as nice compared to the Java 8 way, this is how you would do it in AssertJ 2.x :

. Put the code that should throw the exception in a try-catch.
. Call fail method immediately after, so that the test fails if the exception is not thrown.
. Assert the caught exception.

Note that `fail` method can be statically imported from `Assertions` class.

[source,java]
----
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.fail;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown;
// ... code omitted for brevity

assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).hasSize(9);

// here's the typical pattern to use Fail :
try {
  fellowshipOfTheRing.get(9); // argggl !
  // we should not arrive here => use fail to expresses that
  // if IndexOutOfBoundsException was not thrown, test would fail the specified message
  fail("IndexOutOfBoundsException expected because fellowshipOfTheRing has only 9 elements");
} catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
  assertThat(e).hasMessage("Index: 9, Size: 9");
}

// Warning : don't catch Throwable as it would also catch the AssertionError thrown by fail method

// another way to do the same thing
try {
  fellowshipOfTheRing.get(9); // argggl !
  // if IndexOutOfBoundsException was not thrown, test would fail with message :
  // "Expected IndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown"
  failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(IndexOutOfBoundsException.class);
} catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
  assertThat(e).hasMessage("Index: 9, Size: 9");
}
----

[[assertj-core-recursive-comparison]]
==== Field by field recursive comparison

AssertJ Core provides a fluent recursive comparison API for `Object` assertions with the following capabilities:

* link:#assertj-core-recursive-comparison-strict[Choosing a strict or lenient recursive comparison]
* link:#assertj-core-recursive-comparison-ignoring-fields[Ignoring fields in the comparison]
* link:#assertj-core-recursive-comparison-comparators[Specifying how to compare specific types or fields in the comparison]
* link:#assertj-core-using-overridden-equals[Use overridden `equals` instead of a recursive comparison]
* link:#assertj-core-recursive-comparison-ignoring-all-expected-null-fields[Ignoring all expected null fields]
* link:#assertj-core-recursive-comparison-ignoring-all-actual-empty-optional-fields[Ignoring all actual empty optional fields].
* link:#assertj-core-recursive-comparison-overriding-error-messages[Overriding error messages for specific fields or types].
* link:#assertj-core-recursive-comparison-introspection-strategy[Specifying how to introspect the objects to compare].

The recursive comparison is meant to to replace `isEqualToComparingFieldByFieldRecursively`.

===== Basic usage

The recursive comparison mode starts after calling `usingRecursiveComparison()`.

Here's a simple example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
 public class Person {
   String name;
   double height;
   Home home = new Home();
 }

 public class Home {
   Address address = new Address();
   Date ownedSince;
 }

 public static class Address {
   int number;
   String street;
 }

 Person sherlock = new Person("Sherlock", 1.80);
 sherlock.home.ownedSince = new Date(123);
 sherlock.home.address.street = "Baker Street";
 sherlock.home.address.number = 221;

 Person sherlock2 = new Person("Sherlock", 1.80);
 sherlock2.home.ownedSince = new Date(123);
 sherlock2.home.address.street = "Baker Street";
 sherlock2.home.address.number = 221;

 // assertion succeeds as the data of both objects are the same.
 assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                     .isEqualTo(sherlock2);

 // assertion fails as Person equals only compares references.
 assertThat(sherlock).isEqualTo(sherlock2);
----

The comparison is *not symmetrical* since it is *limited to actual's fields*, the algorithm gather actual's fields and then compare them to the corresponding expected's fields. It is then possible for the expected object to have more fields than actual which can be handy when comparing a base type to a subtype with additional fields.

===== How field values are resolved

The recursive comparison uses introspection to find out the fields to compare and their values.

It first looks for the object under test fields (skipping any ignored ones as specified in the configuration), then it looks for the same fields in the expected object to compare to.

The next step is resolving the field values using first a getter method (if any) or reading the field value. The getter methods for a field `x` are `getX()` or `isX()` for boolean fields.
If you enable bare properties resolution, a method `x()` is also used considered as a valid getter.

Bare name property is enabled by calling `Assertions.setExtractBareNamePropertyMethods(true);` (it is disabled by default since 3.18.0).

Lastly if the object under test is a map, the recursive comparison tries to resolve the field value by looking it up in the map with `map.get(fieldName)`.

Since 3.24.0, you can specify your own strategy on how the recursive comparison resolve the values to compare, go to section link:#assertj-core-recursive-comparison-introspection-strategy[specifying how to introspect the objects to compare] for details.


===== Breaking changes

Since 3.18.0 bare name getter resolution are disabled by default, to get the previous behaviour back, call `Assertions.setExtractBareNamePropertyMethods(true);`

Since 3.17.0 it does not use anymore `equals` methods of classes that have overriden it, so no need to force recursive comparison on these classes. To get the previous behavior back, use link:#assertj-core-using-overridden-equals[`usingOverriddenEquals()`].



[[assertj-core-recursive-comparison-isNotEqualTo]]
===== isNotEqualTo

Since 3.17.0 `isNotEqualTo` is available in the recursive API, example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
// equals not overridden in TolkienCharacter
TolkienCharacter frodo = new TolkienCharacter("Frodo", 33, HOBBIT);
TolkienCharacter frodoClone = new TolkienCharacter("Frodo", 33, HOBBIT);
TolkienCharacter youngFrodo = new TolkienCharacter("Frodo", 22, HOBBIT);

// Pass as equals compares object references
assertThat(frodo).isNotEqualTo(frodoClone);

// Fail as frodo and frodoClone are equals when doing a field by field comparison.
assertThat(frodo).usingRecursiveComparison()
                 .isNotEqualTo(frodoClone);

// Pass as one the age fields differ between frodo and youngFrodo.
assertThat(frodo).usingRecursiveComparison()
                 .isNotEqualTo(youngFrodo);
----

[[assertj-core-recursive-comparison-strict]]
===== Strict or lenient comparison

By default the objects to compare can be of different types but must have the same properties/fields. For example if object under test has a `work` field of type `Address`, the expected object to compare the object under test to must also have one but it can of a different type like `AddressDto`.

It is possible to enforce strict type checking by calling `withStrictTypeChecking()` and make the comparison fail whenever the compared objects or their fields are not compatible. Compatible means that the expected object/field types are the same or a subtype of actual/field types, for example if actual is an `Animal` and expected a `Dog`, they will be compared field by field in strict type checking mode.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class Person {
  String name;
  double height;
  Person bestFriend;
}

Person sherlock = new Person("Sherlock", 1.80);
sherlock.bestFriend = new Person("Watson", 1.70);

Person sherlockClone = new Person("Sherlock", 1.80);
sherlockClone.bestFriend = new Person("Watson", 1.70);

// assertion succeeds as sherlock and sherlockClone have the same data and types
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .withStrictTypeChecking()
                    .isEqualTo(sherlockClone);

// Let's now define a data structure similar to Person

public class PersonDTO {
  String name;
  double height;
  PersonDTO bestFriend;
}

PersonDTO sherlockDto = new PersonDTO("Sherlock", 1.80);
sherlockDto.bestFriend = new PersonDTO("Watson", 1.70);

// assertion fails as Person and PersonDTO are not compatible even though they have the same data
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .withStrictTypeChecking()
                    .isEqualTo(sherlockDto);

// Let's define a subclass of Person

public class Detective extends Person {
  boolean busy;
}

Detective detectiveSherlock = new Detective("Sherlock", 1.80);
detectiveSherlock.bestFriend = new Person("Watson", 1.70);
detectiveSherlock.busy = true;

// assertion succeeds as Detective inherits from Person and
// only Person's fields are included into the comparison.
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .withStrictTypeChecking()
                    .isEqualTo(detectiveSherlock);
----

[[assertj-core-recursive-comparison-ignoring-fields]]
===== Ignoring fields in the comparison

It is possible to ignore fields of the object under test in the comparison, this is can be useful when a field has a generated value (like the current time) or is simply not relevant to compare.

There are a few ways to specify the fields to ignore:

* directly with `ignoringFields(String... fieldsToIgnore)`
* by regexes with `ignoringFieldsMatchingRegexes(String... regexes)`
* by types with `ignoringFieldsOfTypes(Class... typesToIgnore)`

Nested fields can be specified like this: `home.address.street`

It is also possible to ignore the the object under test with `ignoringActualNullFields()`.

Examples

[source,java,indent=0]
----
Person sherlock = new Person("Sherlock", 1.80);
sherlock.home.address.street = "Baker Street";
sherlock.home.address.number = 221;

// strangely moriarty and sherlock have the same height!
Person moriarty = new Person("Moriarty", 1.80);
moriarty.home.address.street = "Crime Street";
moriarty.home.address.number = 221;

// assertion succeeds as name and home.address.street fields are ignored in the comparison
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .ignoringFields("name", "home.address.street")
                    .isEqualTo(moriarty);

// assertion succeeds as once a field is ignored, its subfields are too
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .ignoringFields("name", "home")
                    .isEqualTo(moriarty);

// ignoring fields matching regexes: name and home match .*me
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .ignoringFieldsMatchingRegexes(".*me")
                    .isEqualTo(moriarty);

// ignoring null fields example:
sherlock.name = null;
sherlock.home.address.street = null;
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .ignoringActualNullFields()
                    .isEqualTo(moriarty);

// ignore height and address fields by type:
Person tallSherlock = new Person("sherlock", 2.10);
tallSherlock.home.address.street = "Long Baker Street";
tallSherlock.home.address.number = 222;
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .ignoringFieldsOfTypes(double.class, Address.class)
                    .isEqualTo(tallSherlock);
----

[[assertj-core-using-overridden-equals]]
===== Using overridden equals

Since 3.17.0 the recursive comparison does not use overridden `equals` methods to compare fields anymore, it performs a recursive comparison on these fields, it is possible to change that behavior by calling `usingOverriddenEquals()`.

Once using overridden `equals` methods is enabled, you can disable it for certain types or fields (and perform a recursive comparison instead) using the following methods:

* `ignoringOverriddenEqualsForTypes(Class...)` Any fields of these classes are compared recursively
* `ignoringOverriddenEqualsForFields(String...)` Any given fields are compared recursively
* `ignoringOverriddenEqualsForFieldsMatchingRegexes(String...)` Any fields matching one of these regexes are compared recursively
* `ignoringAllOverriddenEquals()` except for java types, all fields are compared field by field recursively

Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
 public class Person {
   String name;
   double height;
   Home home = new Home();
 }

 public class Home {
   Address address = new Address();
 }

 public static class Address {
   int number;
   String street;

   // only compares number, ouch!
   @Override
   public boolean equals(final Object other) {
     if (!(other instanceof Address)) return false;
     Address castOther = (Address) other;
     return Objects.equals(number, castOther.number);
   }
 }

 Person sherlock = new Person("Sherlock", 1.80);
 sherlock.home.address.street = "Baker Street";
 sherlock.home.address.number = 221;

 Person sherlock2 = new Person("Sherlock", 1.80);
 sherlock2.home.address.street = "Butcher Street";
 sherlock2.home.address.number = 221;

 // assertion succeeds but that's not what we expected since the home.address.street fields differ
 // but the equals implementation in Address does not compare them.
 assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                     .usingOverriddenEquals()
                     .isEqualTo(sherlock2);

 // to avoid the previous issue, we force a recursive comparison on the Address type
 // now this assertion fails as expected since the home.address.street fields differ.
 assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                     .usingOverriddenEquals()
                     .ignoringOverriddenEqualsForTypes(Address.class)
                     .isEqualTo(sherlock2);
----

[[assertj-core-recursive-comparison-ignoring-all-expected-null-fields]]
===== Ignoring all expected null fields

By using `ignoringExpectedNullFields()` the recursive comparison will exclude from the comparison any null fields in the expected object. +
One use case for that is when the object under test have fields with values hard to predict (id, timestamp, ...),  with this feature you simply build the expected object with null values values for these fields and they won't be compared.

Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class Person {
  String name;
  double height;
  Home home = new Home();
}
public class Home {
  Address address = new Address();
}

  String street;
}

Person sherlock = new Person("Sherlock", 1.80);
sherlock.home.address.street = "Baker Street";
sherlock.home.address.number = 221;

Person noName = new Person(null, 1.80);
noName.home.address.street = null;
noName.home.address.number = 221;

// assertion succeeds as name and home.address.street fields are ignored in the comparison
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .ignoringExpectedNullFields()
                    .isEqualTo(noName);

// assertion fails as name and home.address.street fields are populated for sherlock but not for noName.
assertThat(noName).usingRecursiveComparison()
                  .ignoringExpectedNullFields()
                  .isEqualTo(sherlock);
----

[[assertj-core-recursive-comparison-ignoring-all-actual-empty-optional-fields]]
===== Ignoring all actual empty optional fields

`ignoringActualEmptyOptionalFields()` makes the recursive comparison to ignore all actual empty optional fields (including `Optional`, `OptionalInt`, `OptionalLong` and `OptionalDouble`). +
Note that the expected object empty optional fields are not ignored, this only applies to actual's fields.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
 public class Person {
   String name;

----

[[assertj-core-recursive-comparison-comparators]]
===== Specifying how to compare specific types or fields in the comparison

You can specify how to compare values per (nested) fields or type with the methods below (but before calling `isEqualTo` otherwise this has no effect!):

* `withEqualsForFields(BiPredicate, String...)` or `withComparatorForFields(Comparator, String...)` for one or multiple fields
* `withEqualsForType(BiPredicate, Class)` or `withComparatorForType(Comparator, Class)` for a given type

Note that comparisons specified for fields take precedence over the ones specified for types.

By default floats are compared with a precision of 1.0E-6 and doubles with 1.0E-15.

TIP: Prefer using `withEqualsForFields`/`withEqualsForType`, providing a `BiPredicate` is simpler than a `Comparator` (unless you have one already defined).

Examples:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class TolkienCharacter {
  String name;
  double height;
}

TolkienCharacter frodo = new TolkienCharacter("Frodo", 1.2);
TolkienCharacter tallerFrodo = new TolkienCharacter("Frodo", 1.3);
TolkienCharacter reallyTallFrodo = new TolkienCharacter("Frodo", 1.9);

[[assertj-core-recursive-comparison-overriding-error-messages]]
===== Overriding error messages for specific fields or types

If AssertJ difference error description is not yo your liking, you can override it either by fields or types.

You can override messages for all fields of a given type, example for `Double`:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
withErrorMessageForType("Double field differ", Double.class)
----

Alternatively can override messages for some specific fields which must be specified from the root object, for example if `Foo` has a `Bar` field and both have an `id` field, one can register a message for `Foo` and `Bar` id by calling:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
withErrorMessageForFields("id values differ", "foo.id", "foo.bar.id")
----

Messages registered with `withErrorMessageForFields` have precedence over the ones registered with `withErrorMessageForType`.

Example overriding message for a field:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class TolkienCharacter {
  String name;
  double height;
}

TolkienCharacter frodo = new TolkienCharacter("Frodo", 1.2);
TolkienCharacter tallerFrodo = new TolkienCharacter("Frodon", 1.4);

String message = "The field 'height' differ.";

// assertion fails
assertThat(frodo).usingRecursiveComparison()
                 .withErrorMessageForFields(message, "height")
                 .isEqualTo(tallerFrodo);
----

and the error will report the height field with the given overridden message instead of the one computed by AssertJ as with the name error:


[source,text,indent=0]
----
Expecting actual:
  TolkienCharacter [name=Frodo, height=1.2]
to be equal to:
  TolkienCharacter [name=Frodon, height=1.4]
when recursively comparing field by field, but found the following 2 differences:

The field 'height' differ.

field/property 'name' differ:
- actual value  : "Frodo"
- expected value: "Frodon"

The recursive comparison was performed with this configuration:
- no overridden equals methods were used in the comparison (except for java types)
- these types were compared with the following comparators:
  - java.lang.Double -> DoubleComparator[precision=1.0E-15]
  - java.lang.Float -> FloatComparator[precision=1.0E-6]
  - java.nio.file.Path -> lexicographic comparator (Path natural order)
- actual and expected objects and their fields were compared field by field recursively even if they were not of the same type, this allows for example to compare a Person to a PersonDto (call strictTypeChecking(true) to change that behavior).
- these fields had overridden error messages:
  - height

[[assertj-core-recursive-comparison-for-iterable]]
===== Recursive comparison for iterable assertions

`usingRecursiveFieldByFieldElementComparator(RecursiveComparisonConfiguration)` enables the recursive comparison for any iterable assertion as opposed to `usingRecursiveComparison()` which only allows `isEqualTo` and `isNotEqualTo`, the main difference between both `isEqualTo` assertions is that the `usingRecursiveComparison` one will give a detailed differences report while the `usingRecursiveFieldByFieldElementComparator` one will give a generic error message without details.

Another difference is that `usingRecursiveComparison()` exposes a fluent API to tweak the recursive comparison, to achieve the same you will need to initialize a `RecursiveComparisonConfiguration` and pass it to `usingRecursiveFieldByFieldElementComparator`, you can take advantage of the `RecursiveComparisonConfiguration.builder()` to do so.

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class Person {
  String name;
  boolean hasPhd;
}

public class Doctor {
  String name;
  boolean hasPhd;
}

Doctor drSheldon = new Doctor("Sheldon Cooper", true);
Doctor drLeonard = new Doctor("Leonard Hofstadter", true);
Doctor drRaj = new Doctor("Raj Koothrappali", true);

Person sheldon = new Person("Sheldon Cooper", false);
Person leonard = new Person("Leonard Hofstadter", false);
Person raj = new Person("Raj Koothrappali", false);
Person howard = new Person("Howard Wolowitz", false);

List<Doctor> doctors = list(drSheldon, drLeonard, drRaj);
List<Person> people = list(sheldon, leonard, raj);

RecursiveComparisonConfiguration configuration = RecursiveComparisonConfiguration.builder()
                                                                                 .withIgnoredFields("hasPhd")
                                                                                 .build();

// assertion succeeds as both lists contains equivalent items in order.
assertThat(doctors).usingRecursiveFieldByFieldElementComparator(configuration)
                   .contains(sheldon);

// assertion fails because leonard names are different.
leonard.setName("Leonard Ofstater");
assertThat(doctors).usingRecursiveFieldByFieldElementComparator(configuration)
                   .contains(leonard);

// assertion fails because howard is missing and leonard is not expected.
people = list(howard, sheldon, raj)
assertThat(doctors).usingRecursiveFieldByFieldElementComparator(configuration)
                   .contains(howard);

[[assertj-core-recursive-comparison-introspection-strategy]]
===== Specifying how to introspect the objects to compare

Since 3.24.0, you can specify your own strategy telling the recursive comparison how to resolve the values to compare, this is useful if the default strategy does not suit you.

To use your own introspection strategy, you need to:

* implement `RecursiveComparisonIntrospectionStrategy`
* call `withIntrospectionStrategy(myIntrospectionStrategy)` with an instance of your strategy

AssertJ provides a few strategies out of the box:

* `ComparingFields`: introspect fields only (no properties, map keys are not considered as fields)
* `ComparingProperties`: introspect properties only (no fields, map keys are not considered as properties)
* `ComparingSnakeOrCamelCaseFields`: compare fields only, can match camel case fields against snake case ones, ex: `firstName` vs `first_name` which is useful when comparing types with different fields naming conventions
* `ComparingNormalizedFields`: an abstract strategy that compares fields after normalizing them, you just need to implement `normalizeFieldName(String fieldName)`

`ComparingSnakeOrCamelCaseFields` is an example of `ComparingNormalizedFields` that normalizes snake case to camel case.

Here's an example using `ComparingSnakeOrCamelCaseFields` where we compare `Author`/`Book` against `AuthorDto`/`BookDto`, `Author`/`Book` follow the regular camel case field naming convention while the dto classes follow the snake case naming convention.

The recursive comparison would fail comparing the `Author`/`Book` fields against `AuthorDto`/`BookDto` ones, it would not know to match `Author.firstName` against `AuthorDto.first_name` for example but with `ComparingSnakeOrCamelCaseFields` it will know how to match these fields.

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
Author martinFowler = new Author("Martin", "Fowler", 58, "https://www.thoughtworks.com/profiles/leaders/martin-fowler");
Book refactoring = new Book("Refactoring", martinFowler);
AuthorDto martinFowlerDto = new AuthorDto("Martin", "Fowler", 58, "https://www.thoughtworks.com/profiles/leaders/martin-fowler");
BookDto refactoringDto = new BookDto("Refactoring", martinFowlerDto);

RecursiveComparisonIntrospectionStrategy comparingSnakeOrCamelCaseFields = new ComparingSnakeOrCamelCaseFields();

// both assertions succeed
assertThat(refactoring).usingRecursiveComparison()
                      .withIntrospectionStrategy(comparingSnakeOrCamelCaseFields)
                      .isEqualTo(refactoringDto);
assertThat(refactoringDto).usingRecursiveComparison()
                          .withIntrospectionStrategy(comparingSnakeOrCamelCaseFields)
                          .isEqualTo(refactoring);

static class Author {
  String firstName;
  String lastName;
  int age;
  String profileURL;

  Author(String firstName, String lastName, int age, String profileUrl) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
    this.profileURL = profileUrl;
  }
}

static class Book {
  String title;
  Author mainAuthor;

  Book(String title, Author author) {
    this.title = title;
    this.mainAuthor = author;
  }
}
static class AuthorDto {
  String first_name;
  String last_name;
  int _age;
  String profile_url;

  AuthorDto(String firstName, String lastName, int age, String profileUrl) {
    this.first_name = firstName;
    this.last_name = lastName;
    this._age = age;
    this.profile_url = profileUrl;
  }
}

static class BookDto {
  String title;
  AuthorDto main_author;

  BookDto(String title, AuthorDto author) {
    this.title = title;
    this.main_author = author;
  }
}
----

[[assertj-core-recursive-assertion]]
==== Recursive assertions

The recursive assertion `allFieldsSatisfy` lets you verify a `Predicate` is met for all the fields of the object under test graph recursively (but not the object itself).

For example if the object under test is an instance of class A, A has a B field and B a C field then `allFieldsSatisfy` checks A's B field and B's C field and all C's fields.

Example:
[source,java]
----
class Author {
  String name;
  String email;
  List<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();

  Author(String name, String email) {
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
  }
}

class Book {
  String title;
  Author[] authors;

  Book(String title, Author[] authors) {
    this.title = title;
    this.authors = authors;
  }
}

Author pramodSadalage = new Author("Pramod Sadalage", "p.sadalage@recursive.test");
Author martinFowler = new Author("Martin Fowler", "m.fowler@recursive.test");
Author kentBeck = new Author("Kent Beck", "k.beck@recursive.test");

Book noSqlDistilled = new Book("NoSql Distilled", new Author[] {pramodSadalage, martinFowler});
pramodSadalage.books.add(noSqlDistilled);
martinFowler.books.add(noSqlDistilled);

Book refactoring = new Book("Refactoring", new Author[] {martinFowler, kentBeck});
martinFowler.books.add(refactoring);
kentBeck.books.add(refactoring);

// assertion succeeds
assertThat(pramodSadalage).usingRecursiveAssertion()
                          .allFieldsSatisfy(field -> field != null);
----

The above example is best rewritten with `hasNoNullFields()` which is common enough that it is supported out of the box.

The recursive assertion provides these methods to exclude fields, the predicate won't be applied on the excluded fields:

* `ignoringFields(String...fieldsToIgnore)` - the assertion ignores the specified fields in the object under test
* `ignoringFieldsMatchingRegexes(String...regexes)` - the assertion ignores the fields matching the specified regexes in the object under test
* `ignoringFieldsOfTypes(Class<?>...typesToIgnore)` - the assertion ignores the object under test fields of the given types
* `ignoringPrimitiveFields()` - avoid running the assertion on primitive fields



[[assertj-core-soft-assertions]]
==== Soft assertions

With soft assertions AssertJ collects all assertion errors instead of stopping at the first one.

TIP: This is especially useful for long tests like end to end tests as we can fix all reported errors at once and avoid multiple failing runs.

Since soft assertions don't fail at the first error, you need to tell AssertJ when to report the captured assertion errors, there are different ways of doing so:

* Calling `assertAll()` (basic approach)
* Using a link:#assertj-core-junit4-soft-assertions[JUnit 4 rule] that takes care of calling `assertAll()` after each tests
* Using the provided link:#assertj-core-junit5-soft-assertions[JUnit 5 extension] which injects a `SoftAssertions` or a `BDDSoftAssertions` parameter and calls `assertAll()` after each tests
* Using a link:#assertj-core-closeable-soft-assertions[`AutoCloseableSoftAssertions`]
* Using link:#assertj-core-assertSoftly-assertions[`assertSoftly` static method]

Soft assertions comes with a link:#assertj-core-bdd-soft-assertions[BDD flavor] where `assertThat` is replaced by `then`.

If you have created your own custom Soft assertions it is possible to link:#assertj-core-soft-assertions-combining[combine them all in a single soft assertions entry point].

Let's see first how to use soft assertions *requiring an explicit call to `assertAll()`*, the other approaches that don't require this explicitit call are described in the subsequent sections.

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/SoftAssertionsExample.java[tags=basic-soft-assertions]
----
<1> Build a `SoftAssertions` instance to record all assertion errors
<2> Use `softly.assertThat` instead of the usual `assertThat` methods
<3> *Don't forget to call `assertAll()` to report all assertion errors!*

The previous test fails with the message below reporting all the errors:

[source, text]
----
Multiple Failures (3 failures)
-- failure 1 --
[great authors]
Expecting:
 <"George Martin">
to be equal to:
 <"JRR Tolkien">
but was not.
-- failure 2 --
[response to Everything]
Expecting:
 \<42>
to be greater than:
 \<100>
-- failure 3 --
Expecting:
 <"gandalf">
to be equal to:
 <"sauron">
but was not.

[[assertj-core-bdd-soft-assertions]]
===== BDD Soft assertions

BDD aficionados can use BDD soft assertions where `assertThat` is replaced by `then`.

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/BDDSoftAssertionsExample.java[tags=basic-bdd-soft-assertions]
----

There are BDD soft assertions versions for the different soft assertions approaches:

* `AutoCloseableBDDSoftAssertions`
* Using `JUnitBDDSoftAssertions` that takes care of calling `assertAll()` after each tests
* Using a JUnit 5 extension that takes care of calling `assertAll()` after each tests

[[assertj-core-junit4-soft-assertions]]
===== JUnit 4 Soft assertions rule

The JUnit rule provided by AssertJ takes care of calling `assertAll()` at the end of each tests.

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/JUnit4SoftAssertionsExample.java[tags=junit4-soft-assertions]
----

In a similar way you can use `JUnitBDDSoftAssertions`  where `assertThat` is replaced by `then`:

[[assertj-core-junit5-soft-assertions]]
===== JUnit 5 soft assertions extension

`SoftAssertionsExtension` is a JUnit 5 extension that:

* takes care of calling `assertAll()` at the end of each tests
* supports link:#assertj-core-junit5-soft-assertions-field-injection[initializing `SoftAssertionsProvider` field] annotated with `@InjectSoftAssertions`
* supports link:#assertj-core-junit5-soft-assertions-field-parameter[injecting a `SoftAssertionsProvider` parameter] in each test methods

`SoftAssertionsProvider` is the interface that any concrete soft assertions class must implement, AssertJ provides two of them: `SoftAssertions` and `BDDSoftAssertions`, but custom implementations are also supported as long as they have a default constructor. See the end of link:#assertj-core-soft-assertions-combining[combining soft assertions entry points] section for an example.

IMPORTANT: `JUnitJupiterSoftAssertions`, `JUnitJupiterBDDSoftAssertions` and `SoftlyExtension` are now deprecated in favor of `SoftAssertionsExtension`.

[[assertj-core-junit5-soft-assertions-field-injection]]
====== SoftAssertionsProvider field injection

`SoftAssertionsExtension` supports injecting any instance of `SoftAssertionsProvider` into a class test field annotated with `@InjectSoftAssertions`. +
The injection occurs before each test method execution, after each test `assertAll()` is invoked to verify that no soft assertions failed.

A nested test class can provide a `SoftAssertionsProvider` field when it extends this extension or can inherit the parent's one.

You can have multiple soft assertion providers injected into a single test class. Assertions made on any of them will be collected in a single error collector and reported all together, in the same order that they failed.

This extension throws an `ExtensionConfigurationException` if:

* the field is static or final or cannot be accessed;
* the field type is not a concrete implementation of `SoftAssertionsProvider` (or subclass); or
* the field type has no default constructor.

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]

    String name = "Michael Jordan - Bulls";
    softly.assertThat(name).startsWith("Mi")
                           .contains("Bulls");
    // no need to call softly.assertAll(), this is done by the extension
  }

  // nested classes test work too
  @Nested
  class NestedExample {

    @Test
    public void football_assertions_example() {
      String kylian = "Kylian Mbappé";
      softly.assertThat(kylian).startsWith("Ky")
                               .contains("bap");
      // no need to call softly.assertAll(), this is done by the extension
    }
  }
}
----

[[assertj-core-junit5-soft-assertions-parameter-injection]]
====== SoftAssertionsProvider parameter injection

`SoftAssertionsExtension` supports injecting any `SoftAssertionsProvider` implementation as a parameter in any test method.

The term "test method" refers to any method annotated with `@Test`, `@RepeatedTest`, `@ParameterizedTest`, `@TestFactory` or `@TestTemplate`.
Notably, the extension is compatible with link:https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests[parameterized tests], the parameterized arguments must come first and the soft assertions argument last.

The scope of the `SoftAssertionsProvider` instance managed by this extension begins when a parameter of type `SoftAssertionsProvider` is resolved for a test method. +
It ends after the test method has been executed, this is when `assertAll()` will be invoked on the instance to verify that no soft assertions failed.

Parameter injection and field injection can be mixed. Assertions made on the field- and parameter-injected soft assertion providers will all be collected and reported together when the extension calls `assertAll()`.

This extension throws a `ParameterResolutionException` if the resolved `SoftAssertionsProvider` :

* is abstract; or
* has no default constructor.

[[assertj-core-closeable-soft-assertions]]
===== Auto Closeable Soft assertions

As `AutoCloseableSoftAssertions` implements `AutoCloseable#close()` by calling `assertAll()`, when used in a try-with-resources block `assertAll()` is called automatically before exiting the block.

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/AutoCloseableSoftAssertionsExample.java[tags=closeable-soft-assertions]

[[assertj-core-soft-assertions-combining]]
===== Combining soft assertions entry points

Since the 3.16.0 version AssertJ provides a way to combine standard soft assertions with custom ones in a single entry point.

Let's assume we have written an entry point for `TolkienCharacter` soft assertions so that we can write assertions like:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
TolkienSoftAssertions softly = new TolkienSoftAssertions();
softly.assertThat(frodo).hasRace(HOBBIT)
                        .hasName("Frodo");
----
If we want to check standard soft assertions we could make `TolkienSoftAssertions` inherit `SoftAssertions` but if we want to have `GoTSoftAssertions` too then we are stuck as Java does not allow multiple inheritance.

The 3.16.0 release introduced the `SoftAssertionsProvider` interface to define soft assertions entry points.

[.underline]#Step 1# +
The first step consists in extending this interface to expose as many custom entry points as you need. +
The typical custom `SoftAssertionsProvider` interface exposes default `assertThat` methods, as shown below:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public interface TolkienSoftAssertionsProvider extends SoftAssertionsProvider {
  // custom assertions
  default TolkienCharacterAssert assertThat(TolkienCharacter actual) {
    return proxy(TolkienCharacterAssert.class, TolkienCharacter.class, actual);
  }
}

// let's add a Game of Thrones entry point
public interface GoTSoftAssertionsProvider extends SoftAssertionsProvider {
  // custom assertions
  default GoTCharacterAssert assertThat(GoTCharacter actual) {
    return proxy(GoTCharacterAssert.class, GoTCharacter.class, actual);
  }
}
----

[.underline]#Step 2# +
In order to get a concrete entry point exposing all custom entry points, create a class implementing all custom `SoftAssertionsProvider`s and extending `AbstractSoftAssertions`.
`AbstractSoftAssertions` provides the core internal implementation to collect all errors from the different implemented entry points (it also implements `SoftAssertionsProvider`).

To get standard soft assertions, inherit from `SoftAssertions` instead of `AbstractSoftAssertions` (or `BddSoftAssertions` to get the BDD flavor).

Let's define our concrete entry points implementing both `TolkienSoftAssertionsProvider` and `GoTSoftAssertionsProvider`:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// we extend SoftAssertions to get standard soft assertions
public class FantasySoftAssertions extends SoftAssertions
                                   implements TolkienSoftAssertionsProvider, GoTSoftAssertionsProvider {

  // we can even add more assertions here
  public HumanAssert assertThat(Human actual) {
    return proxy(HumanAssert.class, Human.class, actual);
  }
}
----

[.underline]#Step 3# +
The last step is to use `FantasySoftAssertions`:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
FantasySoftAssertions softly = new FantasySoftAssertions();

// custom TolkienCharacter assertions
softly.assertThat(frodo).hasRace(HOBBIT);

// custom GoTCharacter assertions
softly.assertThat(nedStark).isDead();

// standard assertions
softly.assertThat("Games of Thrones").startsWith("Games")
                                     .endsWith("Thrones");
// verify assertions
softly.assertAll();
----

[.underline]#Optional step: create a custom JUnit 4 `Rule`# +

Because our custom assertions are defined in an interface, we can also combine them with AssertJ's
JUnit 4 rule so that we can use our custom assertions as a test rule for use in JUnit 4:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// we extend JUnitSoftAssertions to get standard soft assertions classes
public class JUnitFantasySoftAssertions extends JUnitSoftAssertions
                                   implements TolkienSoftAssertionsProvider, GoTSoftAssertionsProvider {}
----
Then in our test class we use it per normal:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class JUnit4_StandardAndCustomSoftAssertionsExamples {
  @Rule
  public final JUnitFantasySoftAssertions softly = new JUnitFantasySoftAssertions();

  @Test
  public void successful_junit_soft_custom_assertion_example() {
    softly.assertThat(frodo).hasName("Frodo")
                            .hasAge(33);
    softly.assertThat(frodo.age).isEqualTo(33);
  }
}
----

The rule will automatically take care of calling `assertAll()` at the end of every test.


[[assertj-core-junit5-parameter-soft-assertions-custom-injection]]
[.underline]#Optional step: use `SoftAssertionsExtension`# +

JUnit 5 `SoftAssertionsExtension` calls `softly.assertAll()` after each test so that we don't have to do it manually. +
Since 3.16.0 it is capable of injecting any `SoftAssertionsProvider`, we can then inject our custom `FantasySoftAssertions`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@ExtendWith(SoftAssertionsExtension.class)
public class JUnit5_StandardAndCustomSoftAssertionsExamples {

  @Test
  public void successful_junit_soft_custom_assertion_example(FantasySoftAssertions softly) {
    softly.assertThat(frodo).hasName("Frodo")
                            .hasAge(33);
    softly.assertThat(frodo.age).isEqualTo(33);
  }
}
----

[[assertj-core-soft-assertions-collect-listener]]
===== Reacting to collected soft assertions

AssertJ allows to perform an action after an `AssertionError` is collected.

The action is specified by the `AfterAssertionErrorCollected` functional interface which can be expressed as lambda, to register your callback call `setAfterAssertionErrorCollected` as shown below:

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
SoftAssertions softly = new SoftAssertions();
StringBuilder reportBuilder = new StringBuilder(format("Assertions report:%n"));

// register our callback
softly.setAfterAssertionErrorCollected(error -> reportBuilder.append(format("------------------%n%s%n", error.getMessage())));
// the AssertionError corresponding to the failing assertions are registered in the report

Alternatively, if you have defined your own `SoftAssertions` class and inherited from `AbstractSoftAssertions`, you can instead override `onAssertionErrorCollected(AssertionError)`.

Example:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
class TolkienSoftAssertions extends AbstractSoftAssertions {

  public TolkienHeroesAssert assertThat(TolkienHero actual) {
    return proxy(TolkienHeroesAssert.class, TolkienHero.class, actual);
  }

  @Override
  public void onAssertionErrorCollected(AssertionError assertionError) {
    System.out.println(assertionError);
  }
}

TolkienSoftAssertions softly = new TolkienSoftAssertions();

TolkienCharacter frodo = TolkienCharacter.of("Frodo", 33, HOBBIT);

// the AssertionError corresponding to this failing assertion is printed to the console.
softly.assertThat(frodo).hasName("Bilbo");

[[assertj-core-assumptions]]
==== Assumptions

Assumptions provide support for conditional test execution, if the assumptions are met the test is executed normally, if they don't the test is aborted and marked as ignored.

Assumptions are typically used whenever it does not make sense to continue execution of a given test method — a typical usage is running tests depending on a given OS/environment.

All AssertJ assumptions are static methods in the `Assumptions` class, they match the assertion API but are names `assumeThat` instead of `assertThat`.
You can also get assumptions through the `WithAssumptions` interface.

Example resulting in the test to be ignored:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/AssumptionsDemo.java[tags=assumption_not_met]
----

Example resulting in the test to be executed normally:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/AssumptionsDemo.java[tags=assumption_met]

[[assertj-core-javadoc]]
==== Javadoc

http://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.assertj/assertj-core/ is the latest version of assertj core javadoc, each assertion is explained, most of them with code examples so be sure to check it if you want to know what a specific assertion does.
