[[assertj-core-assertions-guide]]
== Core assertions guide

This section describes the assertions provided by AssertJ Core and other useful features to get the best of it.

[[assertj-core-simple-example]]
=== A simple example

Let's start with a simple example showing a few important things.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/SimpleAssertionsExample.java[tags=user_guide]
----
<1> Statically import `org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat`
<2> Pass the object under test as the sole `assertThat()` parameter
<3> Use code completion to discover and call assertions
<4> Chain as many assertions as you need

Except for `isNotNull` which is a base assertion, the other assertions are `String` specific as our object under test is a `String`.

[[assertj-core-supported-types]]
=== Supported type assertions

AssertJ provides assertions specific to the object under test type, the following sections list the supported types grouped by categories.

The provided assertions for each of these types are documented later on.

[[assertj-core-assertion-description]]
=== Assertion description

It is often valuable to describe the assertion performed, especially for boolean assertions where the default error message just complains that it got `false` instead of `true` (or vice versa).

You can set such a description with `as(String description, Object... args)` but remember to do it before calling the assertion otherwise it is simply ignored as a failing assertion breaks the chained calls.

Example of a failing assertion with a description:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/DescribingAssertionsExample.java[tags=user_guide]
----

The error message starts with the given description in `[]` :

[source,nnm,indent=0]
----
[check Frodo's age] expected:<100> but was:\<33>
----

[[assertj-core-overriding-error-message]]
=== Overriding error message

AssertJ tries its best to give helpful error messages but you always change it with `overridingErrorMessage()` or `withFailMessage()`.

Example with this failing test:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{testDir}/example/core/OverridingErrorMessageExample.java[tags=user_guide]
----

The error message is:

[source,nnm,indent=0]
----
java.lang.AssertionError: should be TolkienCharacter [name=Frodo, age=33, race=HOBBIT]
----


[[assertj-core-incorrect-usage]]
=== Avoiding incorrect usage

There are a few things to keep in mind when using AssertJ to avoid misusing it.

==== Forgetting to call an assertion

The main trap is to pass the object under to test to `assertThat()` and forget to call an assertion afterward.
This misuse can be detected by https://spotbugs.github.io/[SpotBugs] or http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/[Findbugs] thanks to the `@CheckReturnValue` annotation on all `assertThat()` methods.

Here's what it looks like in SpotBugs:
[#img-sunset]
.SpotBugs detecting AssertJ invalid usage
image::spotbugs-invalid-assertj-usage-detection.png[SpotBugs detecting AssertJ invalid usage]

The following examples show incorrect AssertJ API usage to avoid!

[.bad]#Bad#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DON'T DO THIS ! It does not assert anything
assertThat(actual.equals(expected));

----

[.good]#Good#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DO THIS:
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected);

// OR THIS (less classy but ok):
assertThat(actual.equals(expected)).isTrue();
----

[.bad]#Bad#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DON'T DO THIS ! It does not assert anything and passes
assertThat(1 == 2);

----

[.good]#Good#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DO THIS: (fails as expected)
assertThat(1).isEqualTo(2);

// OR THIS (less classy but ok):
assertThat(1 == 2).isTrue();
----

==== Calling as() after the assertion

Describing an assertion must be done before calling the assertion otherwise it is ignored as a failing assertion breaks will prevent the call to `as()`.

[.bad]#Bad#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DON'T DO THIS ! as/describedAs have no effect after the assertion
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).as("description");
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).describedAs("description");
----

[.good]#Good#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DO THIS: use as/describedAs before the assertion
assertThat(actual).as("description").isEqualTo(expected);
assertThat(actual).describedAs("description").isEqualTo(expected);
----

==== Calling withFailMessage/overridingErrorMessage after the assertion

Setting an error message must be done before calling the assertion otherwise it is ignored as a failing assertion breaks will prevent the call to `withFailMessage()` / `overridingErrorMessage()`.

[.bad]#Bad#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DON'T DO THIS ! overridingErrorMessage/withFailMessage have no effect after the assertion
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).overridingErrorMessage("custom error message");
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).withFailMessage("custom error message");
----

[.good]#Good#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DO THIS: use overridingErrorMessage/withFailMessage before the assertion
assertThat(actual).overridingErrorMessage("custom error message").isEqualTo(expected);
assertThat(actual).withFailMessage("custom error message").isEqualTo(expected);
----

==== Setting a comparator after the assertion

Setting comparators must be done before calling the assertion otherwise it is ignored as a failing assertion breaks will prevent the call to `usingComparator()` / `usingElementComparator()`.

[.bad]#Bad#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DON'T DO THIS ! Comparator is not used
assertThat(actual).isEqualTo(expected).usingComparator(new CustomComparator());
----

[.good]#Good#
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// DO THIS:
assertThat(actual).usingComparator(new CustomComparator()).isEqualTo("a");
----

[[assertj-core-representation]]
=== Controlling type formatting

Assertions error messages use a `Representation` to format the different types involved. There are multiple ways of registering a custom `Representation` for assertions:

* Registering a default global `Representation` via a Service Provider Interface (SPI) - see <<Registering a default global scope custom representation>> for details.
* Changing the default global `Representation` by calling `Assertions.useRepresentation(myRepresentation)` - see <<Changing the default global scope custom representation>>
* Changing the `Representation` per assertion with `assertThat(actual).withRepresentation(myRepresentation)` - see <<Per assertion scope custom representation>>

The advantage of registering a service is that you don't need any programmatic call, AssertJ will pick it up and use it as the default `Representation`.

Let's go over these different options with a custom `Representation`.

[[assertj-core-custom-representation]]
==== Creating a custom Representation

An example of a custom `Representation`:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// dummy class
private class Example {}

public class CustomRepresentation extends StandardRepresentation { // <1>

  // override fallbackToStringOf to handle Example formatting
  @Override
  public String fallbackToStringOf(Object o) { // <2>
    if (o instanceof Example) return "Example";
    // fallback to default formatting.
    return super.fallbackToStringOf(o);
  }

  // override a predefined type formatting : String
  @Override
  protected String toStringOf(String str) { // <3>
    return "$" + str + "$";
  }
}
----
<1> Extends `org.assertj.core.presentation.StandardRepresentation` to get AssertJ default representation.
<2> Override `fallbackToStringOf` and handle your specific types before falling back to the default formatting.
<3> Change a predefined type formatting by overridding the `toStringOf` method that takes it as a parameter.

Let's see the above custom representation in action when representing `Example` or `String` instances.

This assertion fails ...
[source,java,indent=0]
----
assertThat(new Example()).isNull();
----
...with the following error:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
expected:<[null]> but was:<[Example]>
----

This one fails ...
[source,java,indent=0]
----
// this one fails ...
assertThat("foo").startsWith("bar");
----
...with the following error:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
Expecting:
  <$foo$>
to start with:
  <$bar$>
----

[[assertj-core-custom-representation-default-global-scope]]
==== Registering a default global scope custom representation

You will need to register your `Representation` as an SPI. You need to do the following for that:

* Create a file named `org.assertj.core.presentation.Representation` in the `META-INF/services` directory
* Put the fully qualified class name of your `Representation` in it
* Make sure `META-INF/services/org.assertj.core.presentation.Representation` is in the runtime classpath, usually putting it in `src/test/resources` is enough

This all you have to do as AssertJ will pick up the `Representation` automatically.

[[assertj-core-custom-representation-global-scope-change]]
==== Changing the default global scope custom representation

You only have to register `CustomRepresentation` once but need to do it before executing any tests, for the tests executed before that, AssertJ will use the default representation.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
// to call before executing tests
Assertions.useRepresentation(new CustomRepresentation());
----

[[assertj-core-custom-representation-per-assertion-scope]]
==== Per assertion scope custom representation

Follow this approach if you want to use a specific representation for a single assertion only.

Example with the failing assertions used before:
[source,java,indent=0]
----
Representation customRepresentation = new CustomRepresentation();

// this assertion fails ...
assertThat(new Example()).withRepresentation(customRepresentation)
                         .isNull();

assertThat("foo").withRepresentation(customRepresentation)
                 .startsWith("bar");
----


[[assertj-core-common-assertions]]
=== Common assertions

This section describes the assertions common to all types.

[[assertj-core-object-assertions]]
=== Object assertions

TODO

[[assertj-core-iterable-assertions]]
=== Iterable/Collection assertions

TODO

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions]]
=== Exception assertions

This chapter answers the question: how to assert that an exception has been thrown and check that it is the expected one ?

If you use java 8 or later versions, check the link:#assertj-core-exception-assertions-java-8[Java 8 section] which heavily uses lambdas.
If you use java 7, check the link:#assertj-core-exception-assertions-java-7[Java 7 section] which heavily uses lambdas.

All the available assertions are described in the link:#assertj-core-exception-assertions-reference[throwable assertions reference section].

In this chapter is exception is used interchangeably with throwable.

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions-java-8]]
==== With Java 8 (AssertJ 3.x)

Thanks to lambdas testing assertions in Java 8 is elegant, AssertJ provides different style options:

- link:#assertj-core-exception-assertions-bdd-style[`catchThrowable(ThrowingCallable)`]
- link:#assertj-core-exception-assertions-assertThatThrownBy[`assertThatThrownBy(ThrowingCallable)`]
- link:#assertj-core-exception-assertions-assertThatExceptionOfType[`assertThatExceptionOfType(exception class)`]
- link:#assertj-core-exception-assertions-no-exception[Testing that no exception it thrown]

where `ThrowingCallable` is a functional interface which can be expressed as a lambda.

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions-bdd-style]]
===== BDD style

BDD aficionados can separate _WHEN_ and _THEN_ steps by using `catchThrowable(ThrowingCallable)` to capture the throwable and then perform assertions.

Example :
[source,java]
----
@Test
public void exception_assertion_example() {
   // GIVEN some preconditions

   // WHEN
   Throwable thrown = catchThrowable(() -> { throw new Exception("boom!"); });

   // THEN
   assertThat(thrown).isInstanceOf(Exception.class)
                     .hasMessageContaining("boom");
}
----

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions-assertThatThrownBy]]
===== Exception testing with assertThatThrownBy

Starts with `assertThatThrownBy(ThrowingCallable)` to capture and then assert on the thrown `Throwable`.

Note that if the provided `ThrowingCallable` does not raise an exception, an assertion error is immediately thrown.

Example :
[source,java]
----
@Test
public void exception_assertion_example() {
   assertThatThrownBy(() -> { throw new Exception("boom!"); }).isInstanceOf(Exception.class)
                                                              .hasMessageContaining("boom");
}
----

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions-assertThatExceptionOfType]]
===== Exception testing with assertThatExceptionOfType

`assertThatExceptionOfType` is an alternative syntax that some people find more natural.

Note that if the code under test `ThrowingCallable` does not raise an exception, an assertion error is immediately thrown.

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void exception_assertion_example() {
   assertThatExceptionOfType(IOException.class).isThrownBy(() -> { throw new IOException("boom!"); })
                                               .withMessage("%s!", "boom")
                                               .withMessageContaining("boom")
                                               .withNoCause();
}
----

This later syntax has been enriched for common exceptions :

* `assertThatNullPointerException`
* `assertThatIllegalArgumentException`
* `assertThatIllegalStateException`
* `assertThatIOException`

The previous test can be rewritten as:
[source,java]
----
@Test
public void exception_assertion_example() {
   assertThatIOException().isThrownBy(() -> { throw new IOException("boom!"); })
                          .withMessage("%s!", "boom")
                          .withMessageContaining("boom")
                          .withNoCause();
}
----

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions-no-exception]]
===== Testing that no exception it thrown

You can test that a piece of code does not throw any exception:
[source,java]
----
assertThatCode(() -> {
  // code that should throw an exception
  ...
}).doesNotThrowAnyException();
----

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions-reference]]
==== Throwable reference assertions reference

TODO: describe all assertions with code examples, see http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/core-8/api/org/assertj/core/api/AbstractThrowableAssert.html#method.summary.

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions-hasMessage]]
===== Checking the exception message

There are two ways to check the exception message: `hasMessage(String message)` and `hasMessage(String message, Object... parameters)`, the latter allows you to build the expected message as https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html?is-external=true#format-java.lang.String-java.lang.Object...-[String.format].

Examples:
[source,java]
----
Throwable invalidArgException = new IllegalArgumentException("foo is not a valid input");
Throwable throwable = new Throwable(invalidArgException);

// This assertion succeeds:
assertThat(throwable).hasMessage("foo is not a valid input");
assertThat(throwable).hasMessage("%s is not a valid input", "foo");

// These assertions fail:
assertThat(throwable).hasMessage("bar is not a valid input");
assertThat(throwable).hasMessage("%s is not a valid input", "bar");
----

[[assertj-core-exception-assertions-java-8]]
==== With Java 7 (AssertJ 2.x)

Asserting on exceptions is not as nice compared to the Java 8 way, this is how you would do it in AssertJ 2.x :

. Put the code to should throw in a try-catch.
. Call fail method immediately after the code that should throw the exception, so that if it is not thrown, the test fails.
. Make assertions on the caught exception

Note that `fail` method can be statically imported from `Assertions` class.

[source,java]
----
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.fail;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown;
// ... code omitted for brevety

assertThat(fellowshipOfTheRing).hasSize(9);

// here's the typical pattern to use Fail :
try {
  fellowshipOfTheRing.get(9); // argggl !
  // we should not arrive here => use fail to expresses that
  // if IndexOutOfBoundsException was not thrown, test would fail the specified message
  fail("IndexOutOfBoundsException expected because fellowshipOfTheRing has only 9 elements");
} catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
  assertThat(e).hasMessage("Index: 9, Size: 9");
}

// Warning : don't catch Throwable as it would also catch the AssertionError thrown by fail method

// another way to do the same thing
try {
  fellowshipOfTheRing.get(9); // argggl !
  // if IndexOutOfBoundsException was not thrown, test would fail with message :
  // "Expected IndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown"
  failBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown(IndexOutOfBoundsException.class);
} catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
  assertThat(e).hasMessage("Index: 9, Size: 9");
}
----

[[assertj-core-recursive-comparison]]
=== Field by field recursive comparison

Since 3.12.0 AssertJ Core provides a new fluent recursive comparison API for `Object` assertions, it is meant to replace `isEqualToComparingFieldByFieldRecursively` with more capabilities including:

* link:#assertj-core-recursive-comparison-strict[Choosing a strict or lenient recursive comparison]
* link:#assertj-core-recursive-comparison-ignoring-fields[Ignoring fields in the comparison]
* link:#assertj-core-recursive-comparison-comparators[Specifying comparators to use in the comparison]
* link:#assertj-core-recursive-comparison-ignoring-equals[Force recursive comparison on classes that have redefined `equals`]

This is a *Beta* version but it is worth using it already, we want to have feedback from the community to make it even better before freezing the API.
There are more capabilities to come in the next releases, stay tuned!

The recursive comparison mode starts after calling `usingRecursiveComparison()`.
By default it uses `equals` methods of classes that have overriden it, this can be changed and force recursive comparison on this classes (link:#assertj-core-recursive-comparison-ignoring-equals[see this section]).

Here's a simple example to give an idea of what it can do:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
 public class Person {
   String name;
   double height;
   Home home = new Home();
 }

 public class Home {
   Address address = new Address();
   Date ownedSince;
 }

 public static class Address {
   int number;
   String street;
 }

 Person sherlock = new Person("Sherlock", 1.80);
 sherlock.home.ownedSince = new Date(123);
 sherlock.home.address.street = "Baker Street";
 sherlock.home.address.number = 221;

 Person sherlock2 = new Person("Sherlock", 1.80);
 sherlock2.home.ownedSince = new Date(123);
 sherlock2.home.address.street = "Baker Street";
 sherlock2.home.address.number = 221;

 // assertion succeeds as the data of both objects are the same.
 assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                     .isEqualTo(sherlock2);

 // assertion fails as Person equals only compares references.
 assertThat(sherlock).isEqualTo(sherlock2);
----

The comparison is *not symmetrical* since it is *limited to actual's fields*, the algorithm gather actual's fields and then compare them to the corresponding expected's fields. It is then possible for the expected object to have more fields than actual which can be handy when comparing a base type to a subtype with additional fields.

[[assertj-core-recursive-comparison-strict]]
==== Strict or lenient comparison

By default the objects to compare can be of different types but must have the same properties/fields. For example if object under test has a `work` field of type `Address`, the expected object to compare the object under test to must also have one but it can of a different type like `AddressDto`.

It is possible to enforce strict type checking by calling `withStrictTypeChecking()` and make the comparison fail whenever the compared objects or their fields are not compatible. Compatible means that the expected object/field types are the same or a subtype of actual/field types, for example if actual is an `Animal` and expected a `Dog`, they will be compared field by field in strict type checking mode.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class Person {
  String name;
  double height;
  Person bestFriend;
}

Person sherlock = new Person("Sherlock", 1.80);
sherlock.bestFriend = new Person("Watson", 1.70);

Person sherlockClone = new Person("Sherlock", 1.80);
sherlockClone.bestFriend = new Person("Watson", 1.70);

// assertion succeeds as sherlock and sherlockClone have the same data and types
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .withStrictTypeChecking()
                    .isEqualTo(sherlockClone);

// Let's now define a data structure similar to Person

public class PersonDTO {
  String name;
  double height;
  PersonDTO bestFriend;
}

PersonDTO sherlockDto = new PersonDTO("Sherlock", 1.80);
sherlockDto.bestFriend = new PersonDTO("Watson", 1.70);

// assertion fails as Person and PersonDTO are not compatible even though they have the same data
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .withStrictTypeChecking()
                    .isEqualTo(noName);

// Let's define a subclass of Person

public class Detective extends Person {
  boolean busy;
}

Detective detectiveSherlock = new Detective("Sherlock", 1.80);
detectiveSherlock.bestFriend = new Person("Watson", 1.70);
detectiveSherlock.busy = true;

// assertion succeeds as Detective inherits from Person and
// only Person's fields are included into the comparison.
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .withStrictTypeChecking()
                    .isEqualTo(detectiveSherlock);
----

[[assertj-core-recursive-comparison-ignoring-fields]]
==== Ignoring fields in the comparison

It is possible to ignore fields of the object under test in the comparison, this is can be useful when a field has a generated value (like the current time) or is simply not relevant to compare.

There are a few ways to specify the fields to ignore:

* directly with `ignoringFields(String... fieldsToIgnore)`
* by regexes with `ignoringFieldsMatchingRegexes(String... regexes)`

Nested fields can be specified like this: `home.address.street`

It is also possible to ignore the the object under test with `ignoringActualNullFields()`.

Examples

[source,java,indent=0]
----
Person sherlock = new Person("Sherlock", 1.80);
sherlock.home.address.street = "Baker Street";
sherlock.home.address.number = 221;

// strangely moriarty and sherlock have the same height!
Person moriarty = new Person("Moriarty", 1.80);
moriarty.home.address.street = "Crime Street";
moriarty.home.address.number = 221;

// assertion succeeds as name and home.address.street fields are ignored in the comparison
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .ignoringFields("name", "home.address.street")
                    .isEqualTo(moriarty);

// assertion succeeds as once a field is ignored, its subfields are too
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .ignoringFields("name", "home")
                    .isEqualTo(moriarty);

// ignoring with regexes: name and home match .*me
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .ignoringFieldsMatchingRegexes(".*me")
                    .isEqualTo(moriarty);

// ignoring null fields example:
sherlock.name = null;
sherlock.home.address.street = null;
assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                    .ignoringActualNullFields()
                    .isEqualTo(moriarty);
----

[[assertj-core-recursive-comparison-ignoring-equals]]
==== Ignoring overridden equals

By default the recursive comparison uses overridden `equals` methods to compare fields, it is possible to change that behavior and force a recursive comparison by calling:

* `ignoringOverriddenEqualsForTypes(Class...)` Any fields of these classes are compared recursively
* `ignoringOverriddenEqualsForFields(String...)` Any given fields are compared recursively
* `ignoringOverriddenEqualsForFieldsMatchingRegexes(String...)` Any fields matching one of these regexes are compared recursively
* `ignoringAllOverriddenEquals()` except for java types, all fields are compared field by field recursively

Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
 public class Person {
   String name;
   double height;
   Home home = new Home();
 }

 public class Home {
   Address address = new Address();
 }

 public static class Address {
   int number;
   String street;

   // only compares number, ouch!
    @Override
   public boolean equals(final Object other) {
     if (!(other instanceof Address)) return false;
     Address castOther = (Address) other;
     return Objects.equals(number, castOther.number);
   }
 }

 Person sherlock = new Person("Sherlock", 1.80);
 sherlock.home.address.street = "Baker Street";
 sherlock.home.address.number = 221;

 Person sherlock2 = new Person("Sherlock", 1.80);
 sherlock2.home.address.street = "Butcher Street";
 sherlock2.home.address.number = 221;

 // assertion succeeds but that's not what we expected since the home.address.street fields differ
 // but the equals implemenation in Address does not compare them.
 assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                     .isEqualTo(sherlock2);

 // to avoid the previous issue, we force a recursive comparison on the Address type
 // now this assertion fails as expected since the home.address.street fields differ.
 assertThat(sherlock).usingRecursiveComparison()
                     .ignoringOverriddenEqualsForTypes(Address.class)
                     .isEqualTo(sherlock2);
----


[[assertj-core-recursive-comparison-comparators]]
=== Comparators used in the comparison

By default floats are compared with a precision of 1.0E-6 and doubles with 1.0E-15.

You can specify a custom comparator per (nested) fields or type with the methods below (but before calling `isEqualTo` otherwise this has no effect!):

* `withComparatorForFields(Comparator, String...)` for one or multiple fields
* `withComparatorForType(Comparator, Class)` for a given type

Examples:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class TolkienCharacter {
  String name;
  double height;
}

TolkienCharacter frodo = new TolkienCharacter("Frodo", 1.2);
TolkienCharacter tallerFrodo = new TolkienCharacter("Frodo", 1.3);
TolkienCharacter reallyTallFrodo = new TolkienCharacter("Frodo", 1.9);

Comparator<Double> closeEnough = (d1, d2) -> Math.abs(d1 - d2) <= 0.5 ? 0 : 1;

The https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-examples/tree/master/assertions-examples[assertions-examples] repository hosts executable AssertJ assertions examples that you can run as JUnit tests. Please have a look at assertions https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-examples/tree/master/assertions-examples/src/test/java/org/assertj/examples[examples sources].

The `master` branch contains examples with the latest released version of AssertJ modules for Java 8, similarly the `java-7` branch contains examples of AssertJ modules for Java 7. You should be able to build those two branches with `mvn clean install` command.

In your IDE, add `src/test/generated-assertions` to the project java test sources otherwise you will have errors/missing classes. This is the folder where custom assertions classes are generated by default by the maven assertions generator plugin. Note that Intellij Idea wrongly adds `src/test/generated-assertions` to the production sources when it should be added the test sources, you will have to fix that in your module/project settings.

Building the `with-latest-snapshot-versions` branch is a bit more complicated :

* you need to build the needed SNAPSHOT dependencies before - most probably assertj-core and maybe other modules.
* run `mvn clean install` in assertj-examples/assertions-examples.
* In your IDE, add `src/test/generated-assertions` to the project java sources if you IDE shows errors/missing classes.
